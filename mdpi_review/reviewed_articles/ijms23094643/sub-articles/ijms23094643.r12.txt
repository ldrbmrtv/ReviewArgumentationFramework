Reviewer 2 Report
The author suggest that the vitamin E analog gamma-tocotrienol(GT3) is a promising radio-protectant in nonhuman primates(NHP) with increasing the survival and proliferation of stem cells in intestinal epithelial and crypt.
This was an excellent report on very thorough study. The paper is also generally well written and structured.
