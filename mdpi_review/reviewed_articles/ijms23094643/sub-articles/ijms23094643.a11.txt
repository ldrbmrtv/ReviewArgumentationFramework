Author Response
We very much appreciated the reviewerâ€™s suggestion for improving our manuscript. Typos and grammatical errors have been corrected throughout the MS. The MS has also been edited in response to the comments. all of which have been addressed. Under the Discussion section, we have included a brief paragraph regarding CONOPS. We have further clarified that all four agents approved by the US FDA are radiomitigators for use after radiation exposure (useful for the civilian population) while GT3 is a radioprotector for use prior to radiation exposure (important for military and first responders).
