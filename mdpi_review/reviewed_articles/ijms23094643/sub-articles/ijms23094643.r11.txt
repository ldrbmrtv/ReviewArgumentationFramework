Reviewer 1 Report
This is an important paper, and should be published, since there are limited data available for GI-ARS in nonhuman primates.  I have included some specific suggestions in the attached pdf document (concerning numerous typos - most highlighted in yellow (e.g., lack of noun/verb agreement), as well as some general comments concerning the text and content. One think that I would specifically call out is that it would be helpful to provide additional information and discussion (either in the intro or discussion) about the expected conops where this drug would be useful. Recommend a discussion of the difference between pre-exposure administration (for military troops that might be knowingly sent into harm's way, or perhaps first responders), and post-exposure administration (for civilian populations, primarily, who will not know in advance of their exposure).  GT3 efficacy is for pre-exposure, so is not considered mitigation...also see my note in the text where it is not made clear that other growth factors are effective at +24 hours post-exposure.
