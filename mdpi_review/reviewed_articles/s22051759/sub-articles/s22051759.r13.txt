Reviewer 3 Report
This work presents a channel-based physical layer authentication system for dual-hop wireless networks. Optimal power with respect to the sum of FAR and MDR is also derived. Numerical simulations show the validity of the proposed solution.
The results are plotted vs SNR, it would be good to see how the results vary with the thresholds.
Equation (40) and (42) are the same.
Minor corrections:
Page 2 - "Power P1 , realay recieves and forwards to Bob" -> "Power P1 , relay receives and forwards to Bob"
Page 5 - "and then copared with threshold" -> "and then compared with threshold"
Page 6 - "propabality" -> "probability"
Page 7 - "Based on formula formula (21 )" -> "Based on formula (21 )"
Page 8 - "HRB( k,  t − 1) ≈  HRB( k,  t − 1)," -> "HRB( k,  t) ≈  HRB( k,  t − 1),"
