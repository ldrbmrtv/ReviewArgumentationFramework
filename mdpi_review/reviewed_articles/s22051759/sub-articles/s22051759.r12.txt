Reviewer 2 Report
This study explored the likelihood ratio test (LRT) with cascade channel frequency response which is optimal according to the Neyman-Pearson theorem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed power allocation strategy outperforms the equal power allocation in terms of FAR and MDR. The work is well organized and appropriately carried out.  I have looked at the mathematics and it looks sound. At this p point, I recommend the following comments to be revised and be expressed more analytically in a revised version, as this current work is definitely worth publication.
1) In the Introduction, the authors should summarize their contribution in the introduction section using some bullets or numbers briefly.2)  It would be better to compare the performance of the proposed design with other published work in Table in a new section called Section 2 "Related works".3) References should be provided for the equations which were borrowed from the literature.4)In Table 1, Why you are considered Carrier frequency 2 GHz, why not 2.4 GHz for LTE technology? Also, Subcarrier interval are very tight why not 1.25, 5, 10, 15 or 20 MHz?5)The parameters given in Table 1 need references to support them.6)I recommend providing the figures in the result section with colors to distinguish the lines.7)What are the limitations of this study? and How could/should futures studies improve the model?
