Reviewer 1 Report
In this work, the authors present a physical-layer authentication scheme for dual-hop wireless networks. The proposed scheme utilizes the characteristics of the channel, while two authentication schemes are presented, namely the likelihood ratio detection scheme and the majority voting algorithm. The authors provide an overview of the system model and present in detail the operation of the channel-based authentication mechanism. Moreover, they derive analytical expressions for the two detection schemes and evaluate their performance in terms of false alarm and miss detection rates.
The work is focused on a timely and critical topic, as dual-hop, relay networks, and device-to-device communications are expected to be extensively leveraged in 5G and beyond mobile networks. The operating principles of the two schemes are thoroughly presented, while analytical expressions are also derived. Moreover, an optimal power allocation algorithm is designed in order to further improve the performance of the authentication mechanism. In this respect, the evaluation results show that the employed schemes feature a high level of performance. Moreover, the structure and organization of the paper, as well as the use of the English language, are considered good. Nevertheless, there are some recommendations to be considered as follows:1) The overview of the state-of-art (related works) should be expanded with more details and additional research works.2) For completeness, it would be interesting to describe the impersonation process in the description of the system model (figure 1).3) Some of the acronyms have not been defined (e.g., AF in figure 1 caption, OFDMA in line 73, etc.). The authors are kindly requested to recheck the definitions of all acronyms.4) The text below equation (2) should be revised as: 'The work in [14] obtains ...".5) A table summarizing all notation and symbols used throughout the paper would assist the readers.6) More details on the link-level simulator can be added. For example, what software was utilized?7) In figures 2 and 3, what does the y-axis label (i.e., 'Pd') stands for?8) A paragraph discussing future extensions and applications of this work can be added to the conclusion.9) Most of the references included in this work are a bit dated, thus, more recent references can be added.
