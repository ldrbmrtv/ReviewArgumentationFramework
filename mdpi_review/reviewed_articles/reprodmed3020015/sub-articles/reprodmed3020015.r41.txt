Reviewer 1 Report
The inclusion of the model of Fig. 6 in the manuscript depicts the problem. This manuscript will be cited as evidence of that inconclusive model. The reviewer is not convinced that PGRMC1 level attenuation by miR-98 mechanistically drives attenuation. Cell biology is quite complex, and it remains fully feasible that PGRMC1 levels only correlate with the decidualization process. In the lack of convincing evidence, the manuscript should be rejected.
