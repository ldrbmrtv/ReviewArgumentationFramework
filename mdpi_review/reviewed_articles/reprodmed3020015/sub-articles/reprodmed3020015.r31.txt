Reviewer 1 Report
I requested a major revision, involving expression of an miRNA-resistant PGRMC1 ORF to convincingly demonstrate the mechanistic involvement of PGRMC1 down-regulation in decidualization, rather than a temporal correlation. In response the authors have made minimal changes to the manuscript, effectively restricted to rewording the title, and several minor text changes. Unfortunately, the authors have been unable to demonstrate the direct involvement of PGRMC1 downregulation in decidualization. Since this is the main publishable finding, the results as they stand do not merit publication.

The authors mention technical difficulties in establishing ESCs that express miRNA-resistant PGRMC1. This may be due to stable plasmid selection conditions, which may affect the differentiation status of the ESC cells. It would be possible to introduce an expression cassette via a lentiviral vector at MOI 1. An inducible vector may be advisable, such as tetracycline, IPTG, or other available systems. Such vectors typically include fluorescent protein reporters, enabling discrimination between infected and non-infected cells in one plate, or population separation by FACS.

In conclusion, if this published was published in present form then it would invariably be cited as demonstrating that PGRMC1 downregulation by miR-98 causes decidualization. Since that is by no means certain, the study should not be published in its present form. The opportunity should remain open for the authors to convincingly demonstrate the requirement for PGRMC1 down-regulation in decidualization by performing the requested experiments, or others of their devising. However, in the first instance the manuscript cannot be published as it stands, and should therefore be rejected now with the stated option of subsequent resubmission only if new evidence is obtained.
