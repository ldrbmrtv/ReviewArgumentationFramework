Thank you for taking time to review are work and for giving us the opportunity to comment on the use of U937 cells as a limitation for the work presented. We have included a section dedicated to addressing this in the discussion section, along with supporting references. This additional narrative is added at line 645-660 and highlighted in yellow on the resubmission.
We have included what we have written below for your convenience:
“The U937 cell line was originally isolated from the pleural effusion of a patient with histiocytic lymphoma [42]. Early characterisation studies showed that U937 cells differed from typical lymphoblastoid cell lines [42]. Because of their pro-monocytic phenotype, many regard the U937 cell line to be representative of an AML subtype M5, under the French-American-British (FAB) classification system [43–46]. This pro-monocytic phenotype and cytochemistry, has accounted for the wide use of U937 cells as a model to study AML, including ROS mediated monocyte to macrophage transition [32,49,50]. We identified U937 cells as having a relatively low basal expression of BCAT1 compared other myeloid cell lines [49], which would allow an effective comparison between BCAT1 overexpressing cells to the vector control. Taken together, the U937 cell line presented as a good cellular model to study the putative antioxidant effect of the BCAT1 CXXC motif in myeloid differentiation, which is a defining feature of AML [50]. However, our study is limited to a single FAB subtype model. Future work could extend our analysis and examine the antioxidant capacity of the BCAT1 CXXC motif in other FAB subtype models, for example HL60 (AML, M2) and NB4 (AML M3 aka APL) [45].”
