Author Response
Thank you again for taking time to review our manuscript and provide valuable constructive feedback. We agree with your comments and have addressed these to the best of our ability in the revised manuscript. In order to address your feedback fully, we felt it necessary to split Figure 7. This has enabled us to accommodate the additional representative flow cytometric histograms displaying CD14 and CD68 expression changes. The data contained in the original Figure 7 is now split between Figure 7 (deals with CD14 and CD68 only) and Figure 8 (deals with CD11b and CD36). Changes highlighted in yellow on the resubmission.
In response to your comments:
Fig 7b. We have removed the Giemsa images and replaced with phase contrast images to better show cell morphology under our light microscope. We also include representative flow cytometric overlayed histograms, which display CD14 and CD68 expression changes between our Vector control and WT / CXXS BCAT1 cells. Included on these histograms is the mean fold MFI change (ratio).
