Reviewer 3 Report
The manuscript is clear and well written. The data presented by the authors are robust and interesting but are based on a single AML cell line, which is not a bonafide AML cell line (derived from the pleural effusion of a 37-year-old, White, male patient with histiocytic lymphoma, according to ATCC). Thus, authors should discuss limitations in interpreting their findings.
