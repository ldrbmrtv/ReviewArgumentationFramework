Reviewer 2 Report
This study identified the efficacy of TTFields treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and the combined effect of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo.
The authors suggested that the therapeutic effects of the combination were apoptosis via autophagy.
This is an interesting scientific study, as it concerns the issue of hepatocellular carcinoma, it also has a clinical aspect.
The authors indicated that TTField had potential to be a new treatment option of hepatocellular carcinoma.
The materials and methods section are elaborated in the details.
The present study was examined in terms of autophagy and apoptosis in the antitumor effects of TTField and sorafenib.
However, the exact mechanism of the combination therapy-induced cell death is not yet known as the activation of autophagy in the combination therapy was not increased.
Therefore, I expect further additional examination in the future.
References contain mostly publications printed in the last 10 years.
