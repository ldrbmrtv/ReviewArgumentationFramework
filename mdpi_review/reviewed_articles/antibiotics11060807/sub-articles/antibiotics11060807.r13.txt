Comment’s:
I have completed a review of the manuscript “Effects of typical antimicrobials on growth performance, morphology and antimicrobial residues of mung bean sprouts” (Antibiotics - 1738611). The aim of this study was to understand and elucidate This study aimed to investigate the role of antimicrobials in the growth of mung bean sprouts and to clarify antimicrobial residues in the cultivation of mung bean sprouts. I congratulate the authors for their excellent work, the research is of great importance for the field of the pharmacology and has technical and scientific merit. The information generated will be of great value. The findings indicated that the abuse of antimicrobials might cause potential food safety risks in fast growing vegetables and the monitoring of antimicrobial residues might be necessary to guarantee food safety. Overall the manuscript is a well-designed study, the figures are of good quality and the text is mostly adequate, data were analyzed properly, the search results are consistent and very interesting and it fits the scope of the journal well.
