Reviewer 1 Report
The given topic about the effect of antibiotics on the mung sprouts features is very interesting and highly important for food safety. The article is written in a very good form in all neccessary part. The only minor formal error is that the lines names miss in Figure 2. Generally, I recommend this article for publishing in the present version.
