Reviewer 1 Report

The proposal about “Investigation of the Associations between Diet quality and Health-Related Quality of Life in a Sample of Swedish Adolescents” is attractive. To improve, you need the next questions:
-Abstract: it is not conventional. It is very “fragmented”. Try to elaborate it again.
-Theoretical framework: it is very updated. To be prudent, try to update some references if you find.
-Methods. This paper is based on cross sectional method. Can you justify it in depth? This study includes a size of 1139 adolescents.
-Results. In Results, the separations of text and Figures and Tables is strange (when a paper does it, the trend is to include it at the end of all the paper). I recommend you to alternate them (text, Figures and Tables in Results). Nevertheless, results are well elaborated.
-Conclusion and discussion: They are well elaborated.
