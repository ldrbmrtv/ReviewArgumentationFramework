Line 113-117: ''The participants also completed an electronic version, of the short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to  describe the physical activity habits before and after HICT. Additionally, the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) was applied in order to assess the participants’ health status to perform highly demanding exercises via Google Forms''.....Please add information about the IPAQ-SF questionnaire, even if it is a secondary application tool it is very important to provide information about the questionnaire.
