Reviewer 2 Report
The manuscript has been improved and I am satisfied with author’s responses. I have one request that can be addressed when copyediting the manuscript. The mean ± SD and SWC values in Table 2 should be more appropriately rounded. Three places after the decimal point are too many. One place after the decimal point is sufficient.
