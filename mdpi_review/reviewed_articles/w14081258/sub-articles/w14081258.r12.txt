Reviewer 2 Report
The authors revealed the Structureâ€“biodegradability relationship of nonylphenol isomers in two soils sampled from long-term reclaimed water irrigation field in both China and America. This work sounds interesting and novelty. The manuscript can be accepted after minor revision.

The basic physi-chemical parameters of soils should be given.
The irrigation water physi-chemical parameters should be given.
The kinect models should be given.
Figure 1 should be revised according to kinect model
I strongly recommend the authors to analysis the biomass of the soil samples.
