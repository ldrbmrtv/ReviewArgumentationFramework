Reviewer 1 Report
The authors have done a commendable job addressing my comments and concerns. I am particularly pleased with the effort made to improve the conceptual parts of the paper. The methods and reporting of results are improved. Personally, I would have preferred to see more detail - but this concern may reflect my taste rather than a flaw or shortcoming of the paper. Good work! I hope other readers enjoy reading your ideas as much as I did.
