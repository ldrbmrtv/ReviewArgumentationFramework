Reviewer 2 Report
I think there are some ways in which you may tighten up the description of the experimental design.The comparisons between Jung and Aaker are always interesting - although the small sample size may be troubling to some.  Reviewing the famous Marlbro ads or thinking about the attention David Beckham's appearance in ads for Adidas receives can be understood to represent viewer's interpretation and unconscious assignment of famous archetypes. It is interesting and the work of Aaker may also be interpreted to represent images of Freedom, Social, Order and Ego.  There clearly is a psychological component to the effectiveness an ad may have - although in some cases the appeal of the media selected and the surprising creative are major variables in terms of attention and engagement.
I think that the relevance of the research to practitioners as well as academics needs to include some current findings about ads, their placement and effectiveness. For example the fact that some "heroes" can move across categories - e.g., Tiger Woods for Buick. Time of message delivery and personal relevance to the targeted audience may be ( I believe) of more importance than the creative.  The general and growing aversion to ads - ad blocker or the increased use of native advertising  - sponsored branded content - that appears in desired media channels is a major issue for ad agencies.  I hope the authors find these comments helpful.
