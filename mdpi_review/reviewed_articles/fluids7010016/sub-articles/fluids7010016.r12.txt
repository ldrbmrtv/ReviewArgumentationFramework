Reviewer 2 Report
A certain originality of the present, rather extensive work is certainly recognisable, but also weaknesses in its presentation. Especially section 2, where the finite difference schemes for the individual cases are described in detail, is overlong, which is very tiring even for the most inclined reader. Here I would recommend explaining only the essential ideas and presenting details in an appendix.Also, I believe that the typical reader of this journal, who is more interested in fluid dynamics in general, is not immediately aware of the advantage of not using numerical viscosity, which is why an explanation of what disadvantages such an approach entails would be desirable.
In contrast to the very long section 2, section 4 is kept very short, although I consider it very important.Finally, it should be mentioned that besides the Eulerian and Langrangian approaches to the description of shock waves, other approaches exist, for example, the description of such phenomena by means of a variational principle, see Mellmann & Scholle, Symmetry 13(9), 2021, https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/9/1662, which should also be mentioned.
