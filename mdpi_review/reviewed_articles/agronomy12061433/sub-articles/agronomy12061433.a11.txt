Reviewer 1
The manuscript is generally well written. It presents interesting original results on the assessment of the diversity existing for the sweet pepper local variety ‘Peperone Cornetto di Pontecorvo’. The obtained data can be very useful.
#Answer: Again, we would like to thank You for your attention and for carefully reading the manuscript. We also thank you for the positive and encouraging comment.
There are just a few minor comments:
lines 102 and 113: Were the seeds collected in 2000 and sown in 2021?
#Answer: We better clarified this in the method section (L101, L105-106). 2000 is the year of the establishment of Conservation and Safety Network. In this frame, seeds were collected and maintained in long term storage conditions by Arsial in the subsequent years.
How many seeds were collected?
#Answer: Between 8-10 grams (about 2000 seeds) we don’t think is a detail to insert in the manuscript.
line 115: Did one repetition mean one plant?
#Answer: Yes, we clarified (L116).
line 130: How many fruits were used as a sample of representative fruits? line 135: How many fruits were used as a bulk of representative fruits?
#Answer: We added these details (L132 and L136)
The results are described and discussed in detail.
#Answer: Thanks
We hope that these revisions successfully address the raised concerns, remaining available for any other requests regarding the manuscript.
