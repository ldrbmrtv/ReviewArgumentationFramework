Reviewer 1 Report
The manuscript is generally well written. It presents interesting original results on the assessment of the diversity existing for the sweet pepper local variety ‘Peperone Cornetto di Pontecorvo’. The obtained data can be very useful.
There are just a few minor comments:
lines 102 and 113: Were the seeds collected in 2000 and sown in 2021?
How many seeds were collected?
line 115: Did one repetition mean one plant?line 130: How many fruits were used as a sample of representative fruits?  line 135: How many fruits were used as a bulk of representative fruits?
The results are described and discussed in detail.
