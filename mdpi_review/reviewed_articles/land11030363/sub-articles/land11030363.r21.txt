Some specific comments:
The abstract could be more concise.
The introduction part can highlight the key points and innovations of this paper.
The definite article “the” is missing in many places in the whole article. please check it.
Too many parentheses are used in the essay, which is not recommended in writing.
Line 135: “impairment water resources”  Is this expression appropriate?
Table 1: The pH values are different from those in the previous version.
Attention should be paid to the number of decimal places in all numbers throughout the text.
Line 909: “c, f, f, a” should be superscripts, indicating the author's work unit. Please check the format of all references.
The conclusion is too long and does not highlight the key results.
