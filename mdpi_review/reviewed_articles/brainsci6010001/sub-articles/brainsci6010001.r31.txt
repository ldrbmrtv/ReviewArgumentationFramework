Reviewer 1 Report
My primary concern with this study is with the methodology.  The patients were under the condition of relative sleep restriction (by 2 hours) when they napped in the morning. It is not possible to reach conclusions about REM density during the nap while not taking into consideration the likely confounding effect of other sleep parameters that also affect emotional memory consolidation. For example the differences in sleep duration between the short and long naps (time spent in N1 and N2 but not N3 was statistically significantly different the 2 nap durations) are likely to be a confounder.  The subjects who spent time in REM sleep also slept for a longer duration and most likely completed their sleep cycle from the previous night.   This factor, which is not only related to REM sleep density,  could have had a favorable effect on emotional memory consolidation.
