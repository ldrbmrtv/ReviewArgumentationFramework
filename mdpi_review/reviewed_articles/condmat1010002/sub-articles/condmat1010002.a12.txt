1) The caption has been changed to:
"Energy spectrum from
Eq.~(\ref{eigqn2}) for $r= 1$ as a function of (i) $\alpha$ in the left
panel, and (ii) $k_y$ at $\alpha= 3/5$ in the right panel."

2) We added the following lines in the consluion section:

<< There are certain similarities observed with the $U(2)$ cases. For the metal-insulator transition in Sec.~\ref{trans1},  the behaviour of the extended/localized states in the $k_y$-$r$ plane are similar to that in the $U(2)$ case \cite{Clark}. Again, for the superfluid-insulator transition in Sec.~\ref{trans2}, the presence of the $U(3)$ flux led to a suppression of the values of $J_c$ with respect to the zero fluz case. Such suppression was also found in the $U(2)$ case \cite{krish-kush}.

In general, it might be easier to simulate U(2) gauge potentials rather than U(3) or higher gauge group potentials in cold atom experiments. While systems with U(2) gauge potential can be useful to study fermions with the spin degree of freedom, which is what we find in condensed matter systems, the simulation of U(3) gauge potentials may open the path to  study QCD-like systems.>>
