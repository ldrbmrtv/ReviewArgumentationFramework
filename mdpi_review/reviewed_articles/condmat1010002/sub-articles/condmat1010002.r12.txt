Reviewer 2 Report
By comparing the gauge fields with non-constant and constant Wilson loops, the authors studied  the effects of artificial U(3) gauge potentials on ultracold atoms. The paper reads well and the theoretical model is clearly discussed. Therefore, I would recommend the manuscript for publication in Condensed Matter after the authors make the minor modifications.
(1) Please rewrite the figure caption of Figure 5 to make the statement of right figure clear.
(2) The authors should put more sentences in conclusion of how U(2) gauge potentials is relevant to artificial U(3) gauge potentials on ultracold atoms.
