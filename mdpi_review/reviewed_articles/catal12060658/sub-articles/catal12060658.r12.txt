Reviewer 2 Report
The present article dealing with the incorporation of HPW on Î³-Al2O3, MAP, and MAS for simultaneous esterification and transesterification reactions of biodiesel production using unrefined green seed canola oil, is in the overall well written and contains interesting results. However, in the introduction some important  references on the use of heteropolyacids are missed. Please improve the introduction and discussion citing some recent references dealing with HPW supported on different oxides, such as TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, SiO2, highlighting the effect of the interaction of the heteropoliacids with the supports.
The part related to NH3-TPD must be revised. The only TCD is not appropriate for the evaluation of the NH3 desorbed, another detector such as QM or specific analysers should be considered. Moreover, no details about experimental details are given. So the suggestion is to revise such part.
