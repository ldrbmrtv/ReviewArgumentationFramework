Reviewer 2 Report
The authors tried to improve their manuscript and new references have been added. However, the characterization of the acidic properties is still very lacking and the manuscript cannot be accepted in the current form. The quality of figures 6 (a, c) is very poor, the signals are really noisy. The authors revised the experimental part, specifing that :"the spectrum for the desorption of NH3 was recorded with TCD with temperature rise 169 from100°C to 700°C for the evaluation of the NH3 desorbed and total acidity" but the signals are stopped at 600 °C. On the other hand considering that supported HPWs have been calcined at  450 °C, a TPD process at temperature > 450 °C doesn't make a sense, unless the authors investigate the thermal stability of their samples at T > 450 °C. Other point: XRD patterns are very poor, except that one for HPW. Please, register again and correct the strange behaviour at 2 theta < 10°.
