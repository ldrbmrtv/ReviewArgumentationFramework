Reviewer 3 Report
The authors have answered my primary concern with this study which was the use of the CDAHFD diet and potential complications of mice.  No model is perfect and the fact there was no mortality associated with the weight drop in some treatment groups alleviates my major concern regarding the potential of combined therapy for patient populations in the future.  While I would have preferred some measures to be included (such as food consumption) the authors adequately explained rationale for not being able to do so.  I have no significant remaining concerns with this study.
