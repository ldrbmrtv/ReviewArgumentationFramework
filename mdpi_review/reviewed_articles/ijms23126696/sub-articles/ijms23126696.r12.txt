Reviewer 2 Report
To explore the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH are liver diseases research hotspot. NASH are charactered by steatosis and hepatitis, and some cases could develop to fibrosis/cirrhosis and HCC. In this article, CDAHFD was used to set up mice NASH plus fibrosis model. Authors set up the combined therapy with CCR2/CCR5 antagonist (BMS-687681) and FGF21 analogue synergizes PEG-FGF21 variant (BMS-986171) to inhibit inflammatory reaction and reduce lipid deposition in liver. HE, IHC of F4/80 and Sirius Red were used to observe liver pathological changes. FACS was used to check inflammatory cells changes in peripheral blood and liver. Combined therapy ameliorated steatohepatitis and fibrosis, and they are new approaches to treat NASH patients. It is quite an interesting research article and would help us explore the innovative approach to treat the increasing NAFLD and NASH; however, I still have a few concerns regarding the manuscript.
1.       For the abbreviated word appearing in the 1st time, the whole name should be shown. For example, the whole name of CDAHFD should be shown in Abstract or Introduction, not in the legend of Fig 2.
2.       Fig 1 A, human serum CCl2 concentration positively correlated with liver fibrosis level. Whether did liver inflammatory level correlate with serum CCl2?
3.       In Materials and Methods, 4.5. Flow cytometry of mouse samples. All used antibodies and their fluorescence color have been listed, but please list the positive and negative marker of each cell, such as KC would be F4/80HighLy6CLowCD45+â€¦
