Reviewer 1 Report
The aim of this work is to prepare emulsion gels based on whey protein isolate and gelatin by two different methods: an enzymatic and a physical method. The obtained emulsion gels are well characterized in terms of their structure and rheological and mechanical properties. Droplet size and gelatin concentration are the factors that most affect the structure and texture of emulsion gels..The results of this study are important for structuring emulsion gels and adjusting the texture of food products. The manuscript is presented in a well-structured manner.The references cited are relevant and current, mostly published within the last three years.The results of the manuscript are reproducible using the information in the methods section, but some minor explanations are missing. What equipment was used for the texture profile analysis? Describe the emulsion blank gel. What does the term "wet gel" mean? All figures and tables are well presented. The conclusions are consistent with the presented results of the study.
