Reviewer 1 Report
Dear Author
I have read the revised manuscript (plants -1730298). Entitle: A small GTP-binding protein GhROP3 interacts with GhGGB protein and negatively regulates drought tolerance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) for publication in plants MDPI. This is the second submission made by the author. The author addressed all the questions and suggestions that I raised the issue in the review of the original manuscript. I satisfy the author’s revisions throughout the paper. Especially author improved the introduction and discussion section very well inflow. Now, this manuscript improved the flow of writing, which was comparatively shallow in the original version but in this revised copy author addressed all the quarries and suggestions very well. Before accepting this manuscript if there is anything needed to be revised by the author, especially English grammar, or spell check, I request this manuscript is currently in “Minor Revision” and any grammatical error author may improve in this stage. Thank you.
