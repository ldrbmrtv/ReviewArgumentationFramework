Reviewer 2 Report
Hu et al present the importance of the G protein ROP in the regulation of cotton tolerance to drought. They use several approaches and technologies in order to prove the significance of this protein in drought regulation. They first use the VIGS technology for gene silencing in order to show the importance of this protein in plant survival under stress. Then they use a two hybrid assay in order to identify interacting candidates as well as BFC to test the interaction between GhROP3 and GhGGB. Following several markers they conclude that GhROP3 is a negative regulator of cotton response to drought by negatively regulating ABA signalling and positively regulating IAA signalling. They also show that a type I geranyltransferase protein GGB interacts with GhROP3 and could be modified by the prenylation of GhGGB a modification required for protein-protein interaction.
The experimental strategy of this work is sound and well organised. However I fill that the proof of the GhROP3 prenylation is missing and this could be easily proved by an MS analysis. Also the authors should check the references since a lot of them appear mistaken.
