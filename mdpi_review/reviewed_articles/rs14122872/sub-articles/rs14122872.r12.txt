Reviewer 2 Report
Dear authors
I have both general and more specific comments to your manuscript.
general comments:
When I read your manuscript I cant find a good answer to your title. is it possible to delineate N fertilization using NDVI? I believe based on your results that the answer is no, do you agree?
It is not enough to be able to devide the fields into management zones, you also have to define how much N should be applied to each zone before it is useful for the farmer.
do a search and replace on upper cases like ha-1 which should be ha-1
x is replaced by -

More specific comments:
line 20 - define DDA
line 36 and 37 - is this the reason for increased use of N? I am not sure, I believe it is due to just want to have a higher yield, I would like you to comment this.
line 53 - PA doesnt necessarily increase yield and sustainability, you should be more critical to literature
lin 58 - avoid using etc.
line 83 to 85 - be critical to theses suggestions, is it always true?
line 101 and 102 - you need a reference to this
