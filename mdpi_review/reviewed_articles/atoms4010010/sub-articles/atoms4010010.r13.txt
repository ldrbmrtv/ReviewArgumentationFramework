Reviewer 3 Report
The article presents triple differential cross sections (tdcs) calculations of hydrogen ionization by positron and electron impact, in the relativistic and non-relativistic limit, using relativistic plane-wave Born approximation and non relativistic approximations. The results confirm predictions of other theories. Explanation of the differences between the peaks corresponding to the different projectiles is given. The work and discussion are very short, but still interesting.I recommend it for publication after the authors answer the questions and make the corrections described below:Page 1:* Line 7: it is referenced to the recent theories given in [2] and [3] which are from years 1994 and 2002 respectively. Maybe the word "recent" is not adequate here.* Line 19: "Coulomb system" -> "Coulomb systems"Page 2:* Line 36: "describes the probability": actually it is the flux ratio, and it could be divergent in some cases. I think one should be careful. Maybe the authors could use "is related to the probability" or something like that.* Line 40: "positrons" -> "positron"* Line 43: "positrons" -> "positron" and "ground state" -> "the ground state".Page 3:* unnumbered equation between eqs. (1) and (2) for Vd: in the second term of the right hand side (rhs) the quantities between the vertical bars are vectors and the notation should be different from that of the first term of the rhs, which represent a modulus.* unnumbered equations between eqs. (6) and (7): there should be a connector between the two equations such as a comma or "and", the same for  eqs. (7) to (8) and (9) to (11).Page 4:* Line 80: "of model" -> "of the model"* Line 81: "in first" -> "in the first"* line 86: the gamma letter (the Lorentz factor) must be defined in the text.Page 5:* Lines 103 and 104: Maybe the identification of the used approximation for the three TDCS could be as subscript.* The fact that as the incident energy increases, the TDCS decreases and shifts towards smaller ejection angles for positron impact is said twice between lines 108 and 115.Page 9:* "experimental one" -> "experimental ones"
