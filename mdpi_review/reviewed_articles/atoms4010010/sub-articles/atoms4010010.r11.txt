Reviewer 1 Report
In the paper, the authors report the theoretical calculation of triple differential cross sections of positron ionization of hydrogen atom at relativistic regime to understand the collision dynamics. This research field, concerning the three-body dynamics, is known to be a well-studied area. The main point in this work is to theoretically study relativistic ionization. However, the authors did not show further supports to their calculations, namely, by comparing the present calculations with experiments or other theoretical method (from other groups). The following issues need to be addressed:
1)      In earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], a fully relativistic distorted-wave Born approximation (rDWBA) has been developed to describe the relativistic ionization processes. The authors did not mention this method for discussions in the manuscript. The RPWBA method in the manuscript should be compared with the previous rDWBA  theory. At least the authors should mention the differences of the two methods and how far the RPWBA can be compared to rDWBA?
2)      Again in earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], there are existing experiments of triple differential cross sections for relativistic K-shell ionization of Ag, Au, and so on. The authors did not mention these experimental works in the manuscript. It would be nice if the RPWBA method in the manuscript can be compared with the experiments.
3)      The authors have not carefully proofread this manuscript. Evidences of this includes (i) some errors in English typing, e.g. line 27 and line 119: it should be ‘plane wave …’ instead of ‘plan wave …’. Line between 33 and 34: it should be ‘The scattered positron and ejected electron …’ instead of ‘The scattered electron and ejected positron …’. (ii) There are repeated Bibliography like ref. 11 and ref. 31.
