Reviewer 1 Report
The manuscript: Impact of Changes in Owner Leaving Pattern on Separation- Related Behavior in Pet Dogs in the UK is one more paper on the behavior of dogs in the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the last two years. A catchy topic, but its content  is unoriginal, bringing nothing new to the pre-pandemic science. It seems that the authors of this study have already tackled this topic exhaustively in their previous articles (*Christley, R.M.; Murray, J.K.; Anderson, K.L.; Buckland, E.L.; Casey, R.A.; Harvey, N.D.; Harris, L.; Holland, K.E.; McMillan, 523 K.M.; Mead, R.; et al. Impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on management of pet dogs in the UK. Animals 2021, 11, 5, 524 doi:10.3390/ani11010005;

Anim. 2021, Vol. 11, Page 240 2021, 11, 240, doi:10.3390/ANI11010240).
The entire first paragraph of Discussion repeats what has already been written in earlier chapters (line 372-379).
Line 382-384   „To our  knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence to show a link between changes in dogs’  leaving routines and risk of SRBs.”
The authors take priority in the empirical demonstration of changes in dogs when the routine of the day is disturbed. And changing the routine of the day is a well-known factor influencing the dog's welfare and behavior, including the occurrence of separation anxiety, so the above-quoted sentence should be deleted because it is untrue. The authors have hardly studied all the publications on how dogs behave when daily routines were changed, so the term "first study" is exaggerated.
Line 444 „This study has provided a unique and valuable insight into…..”  the authors also mark their only unique role in the study, which does not bring new content.
Final decision: reject
