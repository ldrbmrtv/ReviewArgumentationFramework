Reviewer 1 Report
As I wrote in the previous manuscript review: “Impact of changes in time left alone on separation-related behaviour in UK pet dogs” is one more paper on the behavior of dogs in the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the last two years. Manuscript has been slightly improved, but my comments were not included. The authors still take priority in the empirical demonstration of changes in dogs when the routine of the day is disturbed.
My final decision: reject
