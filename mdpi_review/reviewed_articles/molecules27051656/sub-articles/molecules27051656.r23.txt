Reviewer 3 Report
The effort made by the authors during the first round of revision is clear and the paper was improved greatly. nevertheless some points were not addressed properly.
1. The molecular study needs a control molecule to compare the results of  L1 and L2. how would we know that −7.7 and −8.8 are good scores or not. Either perform a quick analysis for a molecule known for its tyrosinase inhibition or compare with other studies control that used the same methods in your paper.For exemple in this study "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.078" they used Arbutin to compare the results of their studied molecule.
2. The references are in a weird format containing only the author's name, journal name and date. article title and other data are missing. Reference style followed by the journalAuthor 1, A.B.; Author 2, C.D. Title of the article. Abbreviated Journal Name Year, Volume, page range.
