Reviewer 1 Report

The manuscript by Sharmin Akther Rupa et al, the manuscript has many serious concerns on the basis that it can not be accepted in this journal.  for example 13 CNMR must be 100 MHz not 400 MHz , value must be either ascending order or descending order (13C NMR (400 MHz,DMSO-d6, ppm): 14.82 (-CH3), 149.25 (-C=N-), 153.65 (Ar-C), 125.26 (Ar-C), 140.31 (Ar-C),159.11 (C=O), 130.04 (Ar-C), 112.83 (Ar-C), 109.34 (Ar-C), 123.05 (Ar-C). above example showed the manuscript not written carefully
Second one that is very important for this paper: The activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium (PDB 4j6u) was significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which reveals the antimicrobial activity of the molecule. All  both compounds are biologically active but their activity was moderate which did not support their efforts.
third one their binding study:1. Why did the authors consider Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium N205A mutant pdb id 4j6u? As they did not report any enzyme specific inhibition related experiments.  2. Docking is a preliminary experiment. How did the author validate the docking protocol?The authors are suggested to use some decoy ligands and calculate the enrichment value in order to justify the docking protocol followed by ALA scan (Alanine scanning)  based MD experiments..  In addition authors are suggested to report at list 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability report followed by either MM-GB or PB-SA based thermo data analysis. 3. The pdb id 4j6u does not contain any bound ligand. How did the author select the binding site? If a few sets of amino acids were considered to define the binding site then on what basis they selected them? 4. The authors did not report any Tyrosinase enzyme inhibition assay, they are requested to justify Tyrosinase inhibition as the probable mechanism of action for  these sets of ligands by providing suitable literature references.
