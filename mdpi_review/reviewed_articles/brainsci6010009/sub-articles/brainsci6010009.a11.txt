Comment 1. In table 1, the "-" is used to signify absent values but that should be footnoted in the table precisely what this signifies.
Response to comment: In the revised manuscript, this was corrected as suggested.
Comment 2. In the exposed and control groups were there other related diseases such as Autism? If so, how many and what would happen to the analysis if you removed them?
Response to comment: Both cases and controls could have been diagnosed with autism, but it should have been a relative minority. Autism is relatively rare compared to a 314 diagnosis. This issue was added to the study limitations in the revised manuscript.
“In the present study, neurodevelopmental diagnoses other than 314.xx were not examined among cases and controls. This limitation of the present study should have had a limited impact on the results observed because of the rarity of other neurodevelopmental diagnoses as compared to a 314.xx diagnosis, but future studies could further evaluate this phenomenon.”
Comment 3. On page 3 line 22, they describe children with the diagnosis before the exposure. How many were there that fit in this category?
Response to comment: We don’t have the exact number, but it is assumed to be a relatively small number.
Comment 4. On page 11 line 4 you say levels of Hg in the environment and in humans are increasing but your reference #26 doesn't speak to that point. Are there better references to substantiate this point?
Response to comment: In the revised manuscript, this was corrected with a better reference.
Comment 5. Can the authors address this point: is this database publicly available?
Response to comment: In the revised manuscript, this information was added.
