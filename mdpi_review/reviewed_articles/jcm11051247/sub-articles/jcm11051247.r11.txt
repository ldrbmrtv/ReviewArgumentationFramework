Reviewer 1 Report
This study has a design flaw. The impact of Tocilizumab on radiological changes can not be adequately analyzed without a control group not receiving the drug.The proposed timing of Tocilizumab administration based on oxygen flow rate is interesting but undoubtedly requires a more detailed statistical analysis to convince the readers.
