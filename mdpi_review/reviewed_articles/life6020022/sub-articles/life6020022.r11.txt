Reviewer 1 Report

In the manuscript ‘Testing the Effects of Low-Temperature Plasma-Sterilization on Mars Analog Soil Samples Intermixed with Deinococcus radiodurans’ by Schirmack et al., the results of the application of low-temperature plasma on Mars regolth simulant mixed with cells of the bacterium D. radiodurans were reported. Two different gas mixtures were used to produce plasma, argon-nitrogen and argon-oxygen. The exposure times varied from 1.5 to 45 min with different experiment Conditions/procedures without resulting in a significant inactivating effect on the bacterial cells.
Comments:
The plasma conditions are not described sufficiently. It is only stated that the argon-nitrogen mixture ‘mainly emits high amounts of radiation  in the wavelength region from 100 nm to 400 nm’ without specifying what high fluences at the sample site are. The term amount is not applicable here. With the knowledge of the spectral irradiance in the UV range from 100 to 400 nm the authors could have made a calculation to estimate the inactivation of D. radiodurans by the UV component of the plasma.
The other potentially inactivating components of the plasma are not specified in the manuscript.  For the argon-oxygen gas mixture it is stated that ‘high amounts of reactive oxygen species are formed in the plasma’ again without any qualitative and quantitative description.  Estimations of the average free length of path for the inactivating plasma components might have been helpful for experiment planning.
Three different Mars regolith simulants were used. The mineralogical composition is given in table, but not the grain size distribution. Knowing the grain sizes and assuming a homogeneous distributrion of cells and grains or a measurement of the real distribution an assessment can be made about the shading effect of the grains with respect to UV radiation.
The authors should have estimated the maximal theoretically achievable effect and to plan the experiments accordingly.
