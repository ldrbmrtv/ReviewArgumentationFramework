Reviewer 1 Report
I think the paper, and especially the abstract, are much improved.  Both in terms of readability and accessibility, but also in terms of context and framing.
I think the paper has the ability to make a contribution to the literature in a way that the previous version may not have been able to.
I think mentioning the scenario approach in the abstract might be worthwhile, but I don't think it's a huge problem if it isn't mentioned.  Either way, I think the paper is in much better shape.
