Reviewer 1 Report
This manuscript adds evidence that NR2F1 is a dormancy marker. In addition, it shows that NR2F1 is primarily expressed in CAFs, particularly in inflammatory CAFs. Given that dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) highly express NR2F1 (Fluegel et al. Nat Cell Biol 2017), it is puzzling how NR2F1 in CAFs of the primary tumor would contribute to dormancy of DTCs. It would be nice, if the authors would discuss this important point in more detail.

The authors choose chemotherapy as a treatment option to compare it with NR2F1 levels. It would be interesting to see, how NR2F1 levels would change with endocrine treatment and/or endocrine resistance.

Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease. Different subtypes behave differently in many aspects. It would be great to see some subtype-specific data.

The authors state “We demonstrated that the expression of NR2F1, RARB, and TGFB1 genes are higher in previously established dormant cells (D2OR murine breast cancer cells [44] compared to the proliferative cells (D2A1 cells) in  both 2D and 3D cultures (Figure 1A, all p < 0.02).” This is not true for NR2F1 in 2D. Please correct.
