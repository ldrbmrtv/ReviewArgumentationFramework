Reviewer 2 Report
The manuscript  entitled "Minigene splicing assays identify 20 spliceogenic variants of the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene RAD51C authored by Sanoguera-Miralles et al., is a very interesting study. It reports novel results and deserves publication in Cancers. Actually, not many publications report variants affecting splicing of RAD51C. The manuscript is very well written, clear and well discussed; I have just few comments: in the Introduction in the sentence 61-69 the authors do not mention anything about BRCA1 (they mention MLH1 though); I would expect that as BRCA1 splice variants are  deeply studied. In the Materials and Methods, the section 2.6 is not actually a section that described some methodology. It appears to be more appropriate as results and maybe some information could be in the introduction. The acronyms need to be explained. Not all readers are familiar with PTC (premature termination codon) and NMD (nonsense mediated decay); as some variants are found PTC-NMD, this needs to be explained better. I would also stress a little more  that FL is almost undetectable.
In conclusion, the manuscript is acceptable after minor revision
