Reviewer 3 Report
The manuscript "Minigene splicing assays identify 20 spliceogenic variants of the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene RAD51C" by Sanoguera-Miralles et al. describes about the analysis of RAD51C variants using mini-gene assays for splicing defect. Many nucleotide variants, whether they affect protein changes or not can affect potential splicing of exons. In the analysis of variants it is very relevant. The authors used bioinformatic analysis to sort out variants that potentially affect splicing and then analyzed them using mini-gene assays. Although mini-gene assays sometimes is not reflective for the splicing of whole gene in a particuar locus but it is now is an well accepted preliminary screening assay. It is difficult to call the variants as deleterious or neutral based on only splicing assays. Overall manuscript is well written, very relevant for variant analysis and is suitable for publication if they address the following concerns:
1) Splicing variants are called solely based on the size difference. It is good to look into Sanger sequence of splice variants after gel elution of the band and sequencing.
