Reviewer #2 (Comments to the Author):
This manuscript relates to the effect of dysprosium substitution in Ce:YIG thin films and in particular to the temperature dependance of their Faraday rotation. It is in general well written and the work deserves publication.
Response: Thanks for your recognition of our work. We have answered the questions as follows.
Point 1: For several references, the text "Error! Reference source not found" appears. Please check with the editor if this can be fixed.
Response 1: Thanks for correcting this. We have updated the references and revised this in the context.
Revisions: Page 1, line 21, revised to “for silicon integrated photonic circuits (PICs) [1-3].”. Page 1, line 24, revised to “including optical isolators [4-6]”. Page 1, line 41, revised to “which results in reduced bandwidth and isolation ratio [13].”. Page 1, line 45, revised to “in a temperature range of 20-60 ℃ [10].”. Page 5, line 148, revised to “measure the temperature stability of Dy:CeIG and Ce:YIG films[11].”.
Point 2: In equation (2) and the following line, there are inconcistencies in the use of capital letters for the Faraday rotation angles.
Response 2: Thanks for correcting this. We have revised this in the context.
Revisions: Page 3, line 98, revised to “where  is the Faraday rotation angle of MO films at room temperature.  is the NRPS at room temperature.”
Point 3: Line 111. "X-ray diffraction patterns", not "spectra".
Response 3: Thanks for correcting this. “X-ray diffraction spectra” has been revised into “X-ray diffraction patterns”.
Revisions: Page 3, line 109, revised to “X-ray diffraction patterns”.
Point 4: Figures 2 (c) and (d). While the Faraday rotation angle appears to decrease more or less linearly with temperature in the Ce:YIG film (as far as can be inferred from the non-linear horizontal scale), the decrease is not taking place at the same rate in the Dy:Ce:YIG film. What causes this different behavior?
Response 4: Thanks for the commerts. The saturation magnetization of rare-earth doped YIG affects the Faraday rotation angle. Sayetat et al. and Ostorero et al. previously reported that the compensation temperature of DyIG is Tcomp = 225 K [1,2], which could decrease the Faraday rotation angle of Dy:CeIG in this work at the temperature below 300 K. Therefore, a higher Faraday rotation may be related to the increase of the saturation magnetization of this material in this temperature range.
Revisions: Page 5, line 170-173, added “The increase of the Faraday rotation below 40 ℃ is possibly due to the increase of the magnetization of this material at this temperature range, considering a compensation temperature of 225 K in Dy3Fe5O12 [19,20].”.
Point 5: Figures 3 (a) and (b): It could be good to use the same horizontal scale for a clearer comparison.
Response 5: Thanks for pointing this out. We have revised the Figure 3.
Revisions: Page 6, revised the horizontal scale of Figure 3 (c) and updated Figure 3 (c).
