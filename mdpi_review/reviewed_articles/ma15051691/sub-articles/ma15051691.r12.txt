Reviewer 2 Report
This manuscript relates to the effect of dysprosium substitution in Ce:YIG thin films and in particular to the temperature dependance of their Faraday rotation. It is in general well written and the work deserves  publication. There are just a few issues that the authors should take into account for further improving their paper prior to acceptance:
1) For several references, the text "Error! Reference source not found" appears. Please check with the editor if this can be fixed.
2) In equation (2) and the following line, there are inconcistencies in the use of capital letters for the Faraday rotation angles.
3) Line 111. "X-ray diffraction patterns", not "spectra".
4) Figures 2 (c) and (d). While the Faraday rotation angle appears to decrease more or less linearly with temperature in the Ce:YIG film (as far as can be inferred from the non-linear horizontal scale), the decrease is not taking place at the same rate in the Dy:Ce:YIG film. What causes this different behavior?
5) Figures 3 (a) and (b): It could be good to use the same horizontal scale for a clearer comparison.
