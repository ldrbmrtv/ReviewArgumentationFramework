Reviewer 1 Report
The article "Dysprosium substituted Ce:YIG thin films for temperature in-2 sensitive integrated optical isolator applications contains the results" presents a temperature stable magneto-optical material Dy2Ce1Fe5O12 for silicon integrated nonreciprocal photonic device applications. demonstrate a temperature stable magneto-optical material Dy2Ce1Fe5O12 for silicon integrated nonreciprocal photonic device applications. By replacing Y3+ ions with Dy3+ ions in Ce:YIG, authors demonstrate less than ±5% variation of the thin film Faraday rotation from the temperature of 25 ℃ to 70 ℃, compared to ~20% in Ce:YIG. It is shown that integrated MO isolators consist of Dy:CeIG thin films show better temperature stability compared to Ce:YIG based devices in the temperature range of 23 ℃ to 70 ℃.
The article contains many original results of undeniable practical significance. It will be of interest to a wide range of researchers involved in magneto-optical resonators.
There are several questions about the content of the article.
1) It is not indicated in the introduction whether any alternative to thin films of yttrium iron garnet is currently being considered for use as magneto-optical resonators.2) How will the temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation hysteresis loops of Dy:CeYIG thin films change when moving to another wavelength range? Is there any dependence on the wavelength?3) How can one explain the increase in the value of the Faraday rotation angle in the range of 30-40 degrees for Dy:CeYIG (Fig. 3f), which is absent for Ce:YIG (Fig. 3f)?
