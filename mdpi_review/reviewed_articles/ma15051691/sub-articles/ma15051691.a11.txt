Reviewer #1 (Comments to the Author):
The article "Dysprosium substituted Ce:YIG thin films for temperature in-2 sensitive integrated optical isolator applications contains the results" presents a temperature stable magneto-optical material Dy2Ce1Fe5O12 for silicon integrated nonreciprocal photonic device applications. demonstrate a temperature stable magneto-optical material Dy2Ce1Fe5O12 for silicon integrated nonreciprocal photonic device applications. By replacing Y3+ ions with Dy3+ ions in Ce:YIG, authors demonstrate less than ±5% variation of the thin film Faraday rotation from the temperature of 25 ℃ to 70 ℃, compared to ~20% in Ce:YIG. It is shown that integrated MO isolators consist of Dy:CeIG thin films show better temperature stability compared to Ce:YIG based devices in the temperature range of 23 ℃ to 70 ℃.
The article contains many original results of undeniable practical significance. It will be of interest to a wide range of researchers involved in magneto-optical resonators.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s comments to our work. We answer the reviewer’s questions as follows.
Point 1: It is not indicated in the introduction whether any alternative to thin films of yttrium iron garnet is currently being considered for use as magneto-optical resonators.
Response 1: Thanks for the commerts. To the best of our knowledge, rare earth doped yttrium iron garnet is still the main material used for magneto-optical devices. They include bismuth doped YIG, bismuth, terbium doped YIG and cerium doped YIG. Other materials such as Wely semimatels are still under theoretical study[1]. We have added comments to these materials in the manuscript.
Revisions: Page 1, line 21, added “At present, rare earth doped yttrium iron garnet (RIG) is the most widely used magneto-optical material in integrated MO devices.”
Point 2: How will the temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation hysteresis loops of Dy:CeYIG thin films change when moving to another wavelength range? Is there any dependence on the wavelength?
Response 2: Thanks for the commerts. Absoultly there is also temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation when shift to other wavelengths. However, the transparency window of this material is in the 1550 nm wavelength range. When moving to shorter wavelengths, the absorption of this material increases sharply, making them less practical for photonic device applications.
Point 3: How can one explain the increase in the value of the Faraday rotation angle in the range of 30-40 degrees for Dy:CeYIG (Fig. 3f), which is absent for Ce:YIG (Fig. 3f)?
Response 3: Thanks for the commerts. The saturation magnetization of rare-earth doped YIG affects the Faraday rotation angle. Sayetat et al. and Ostorero et al. previously reported that the compensation temperature of DyIG is Tcomp = 225 K [2,3], which could decrease the Faraday rotation angle of Dy:CeIG in this work at the temperature below 300 K. Therefore, a higher Faraday rotation may be related to the increase of the saturation magnetization of this material in this temperature range.
Revisions:Page 5, line 170-173, added “The increase of the Faraday rotation below 40 ℃ is possibly due to the increase of the magnetization of this material at this temperature range, considering a compensation temperature of 225 K in Dy3Fe5O12 [19,20].”.
