Reviewer 2 Report
Overall, this is a well written, albeit limited, study on a novel topic.
For the reader not familiar with the concepts of measuring skin tightening and brightening, a brief review of the F Ray 3D measurement  and the Image pro plus systems would be helpful.  How do statistically significant changes correlate with clinically evident findings?

The authors should address how sleeping habits may impact the results, ie individuals often predominantly sleep on one side of their face.  How was this accounted for in the analysis of the results?

A few additional questions for the authors to consider addressing: How was the length of the study chosen? How would the duration of exposure be expected to impact the effects? What is the natural course of the skin changes following cessation of exposure?
