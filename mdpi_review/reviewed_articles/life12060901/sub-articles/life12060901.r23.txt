Reviewer 3 Report
I thank the authors for submitting a revised version of their manuscript entitled “Self-reported long COVID in the general population: sociodemographic and health correlates in a cross-national sample”.
The authors did a great job, improved their manuscript according to my suggestions, and responded to all my questions adequately. In my opinion, the revised manuscript increased a lot in comparison to the first version. Everything read more smoothly and I could follow authors’ argumentations easily, especially the non-significant gender effect and the interpretation of the interaction effects.
Before a final publication of this paper, I have two minor points left:
(1) Wrong column headings in tables: I detected that the authors replaced “GHQ” with “psychological distress” in the text (also “PSS” replaced with “perceived stress”). This is correct. Psychological distress is the latent construct which is measured with the instrument GHQ. Unfortunately, the authors missed to replace GHQ by psychological distress in Table 4 (page 7, line 280) and Table 5 (page 7, line 297; see column headings: not “GHQ”, “Fatigue”, and “Perceived stress” but rather “Psychological distress”, “Fatigue”, and “Perceived stress”). Please correct the two tables.
(2) Wrong use of abbreviations: The authors introduced the abbreviation “GHQ-12” for the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (see page 4, line 161), but wrote in the text only "GHQ" (e.g., page 5, line 207; page 6, line 256; page 7, line 274). Please replace every single “GHQ” in the text with the correct abbreviation “GHQ-12”. Please repeat this procedure for “PSS-10” (see page 4, line 185), i.e. replace “PSS” with “PSS-10” in the whole text.
