Reviewer 1 Report
The authors admit that, line 367, younger people were overrepresented, but to me, it was that older persons, especially over age 70, who were somehow missed in the survey sampling process.  The study offers little to say about long covid among the elderly.
The authors consider a number of factors associated with long COVID and psychological symptoms.  I would suggest another factor - frustration with not getting well.  Normally, you get sick, you get better (if you don't die).  You get injured moderately and you get better with time.  Long COVID breaks that pattern - you get sick and stay sick.  Like being sick and tired of being sick and tired.  Some uncommon illnesses may act that way, but COVID has become endemic and common.  What is your common cold lasted for ten months?  People would get really irritated and discouraged by such a situation.
