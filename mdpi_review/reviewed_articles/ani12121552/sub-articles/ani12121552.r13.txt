Reviewer 3 Report
The Authors assessed the effect of varying doses of ZnO on rearing results (ADG, ADFI) of post weaning piglets, Zn serum status, the probability of diarrhea, and the number of Lactobacilli and E. coli bacteria in feces. Based on the obtained results, the Authors postulate an increase in the level of Zn in the diet for weaned piglets up to 1400 mg / kg of feed to cover their requirements for this ingredient.
It expands knowledge about the needs of weaned piglets regarding the need for Zn. However, increasing Zn in feed is associated with the risk of excretion of Zn in feces and its negative effects on the environment. It is a pity that the Authors did not investigate this.
The topic is up to date. Restrictions on the use of Zn are being introduced, but we must remember to cover the needs of young pigs for this element.
The conclusions are correct.
The paper is suitable for publication in the journal Animals after filling in the gaps regarding the reference sources, page 10 does not contain text (?).
