Reviewer 4 Report
Dear authors,
Thank you for revising and taking into consideration this reviewer's comments and suggestions.
There is only one minor issue to be solved. The authors indicated that the following sentence at L438 of the lastest version of the manuscript was removed but it was not: "but it could be due to a high hygiene 438 level in the experimental barn".
Please, remove it was claimed.

Thank you
