Reviewer 1

The authors report a series of nine patients undergoing 11 surgeries for newly diagnosed or recurrent chordoma. The authors describe their surgical approach using a multimodality image guided operating suite.  As we all know surgery of chordomas, especially of recurrent chordomas, is challenging and the authors should be congratulated for their thoroughly surgical planning and approaches, using elaborate pre- and intraoperative imaging, which is well described throughout the manuscript. The number of patients presented is low. However, chordoma is a rare disease and reports on large patient series are rare. However, patientsâ€™ symptoms, tumour location, surgical approach, imaging, complications and outcome are well documented in the tables, and additionally illustrated by two case reports. There is not much to add and publication can be recommended.
Comments
How is subtotal resection defined in chordoma (% of volume remaining?)
What means Volume reduction 0 and 0% in Table 4?
What means Pathology 0 in table 4?
Response

We are grateful to the reviewer for their favorable review and constructive input

1-Subtotal resection is usually defined as a resection of 95-90%, with <90% defined as partial. We addended the submission in line 93-95 as well as table 4 as recommended.

2- and 3- : We are grateful to the reviewer for catching these mistakes. Both volume reduction and pathology associated numbers are formatting errors and we addended the table to correct these mistakes.
