Reviewer 1 Report
The authors report a series of nine patients undergoing 11 surgeries for newly diagnosed or recurrent chordoma. The authors describe their surgical approach using a multimodality image guided operating suite.  As we all know surgery of chordomas, especially of recurrent chordomas, is challenging and the authors should be congratulated for their thoroughly surgical planning and approaches, using elaborate pre- and intraoperative imaging, which is well described throughout the manuscript. The number of patients presented is low. However, chordoma is a rare disease and reports on large patient series are rare. However, patientsâ€™ symptoms, tumour location, surgical approach, imaging, complications and outcome are well documented in the tables, and additionally illustrated by two case reports. There is not much to add and publication can be recommended.
