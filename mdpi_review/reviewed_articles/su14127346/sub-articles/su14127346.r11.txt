Reviewer 1 Report
I believe that, despite being a topic that is widely discussed in the literature, it is interesting to be able to provide new orientations, in this case the gender diversity firmsâ€™ environmental performances . I see the work interesting, although it needs a good reorientation, in order to make it more attractive to reading. I consider the paper can bring interesting contributions in various fields. However, I will make some suggestions, so that it can be improved.
1- need to update the literature review with recent studies
2- Please add a theoretical background section
3- What are the policy implications of your study
4- Add discussion of results section and relate your results with theories.
