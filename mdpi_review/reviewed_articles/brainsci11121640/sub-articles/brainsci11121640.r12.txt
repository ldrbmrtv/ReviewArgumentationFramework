Reviewer 2 Report
This study investigated whether the modified 30 Hz/6 Hz TBS protocol (intermittent mode) proposed by Goldsworthy et al. (2012) would lead to lasting MEP facilitation. Some questions please need authors to answer.
Why did not compare to the sham stimulation group and 50 Hz/ 5 Hz standard iTBS protocol? I think COVID-19 is not reason. Do you think 30 Hz/6 Hz TBS protocol (intermittent mode) increased MEP amplitude as compared to 50 Hz/ 5 Hz standard iTBS? What are the benefits of 30 Hz/6 Hz TBS protocol (intermittent mode) in comparison with 50 Hz/ 5 Hz standard iTBS?
Does the participants have a neurological disease or other diseases? Please write in the manuscript.
The single-pulse TMS elicited 20 MEPs at baseline but at three specific time points after post-iTBS (i.e., 5-, 20- and 45-min) just elicited 15 MEPs respectively. Why did not also test 20, 25 or 30 MEPs?
In figure 1, the rMT needs to be defined.
In line 125, MT needs to be defined.
Please do not define aMT the second time in line 134.
In line 145, full stop marked an error.
In line 28, please define rTMS.
How do you test the aMT and rMT? Please give the detailed process.
How do you get the hotspot? Please give the detailed process.
In lines 459 and 461, pay attention to the space between words.
