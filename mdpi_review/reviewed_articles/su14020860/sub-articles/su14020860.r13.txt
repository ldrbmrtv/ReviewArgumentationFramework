Reviewer 3 Report
The paper studies the relationship between remuneration committees and CSR as well as the moderating role of independent directors. While the paper seems interesting I have several concerns that I would like to share with the authors:
The introduction lacks of motivation. The reader needs to understand why your research question is important.
The theoretical background is weak. I am not convinced on your explanation on why committees would affect CSR.
Your empirical model needs to be reconsidered. Indeed, I believe you have some omitted control variables which may cause an endogeneity issue and drive your findings
The paper lacks of robustness checks
The conclusion needs to be rewritten to highlight the practical contributions of the paper
