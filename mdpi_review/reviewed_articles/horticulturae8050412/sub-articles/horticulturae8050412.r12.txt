Reviewer 2 Report
The paper by Zhu and coworkers deal with the functional deeeping on te role of gene OfSPL11 from Osmanthus fragrant. This goal was achieved using transgenic lines to investigate the role of this gene in salt stress response. A deeeping on protein an nucleotide structures was also reported. Results clearly  describe the protein localization as well as its role in stress response. In this view, I've only some few questions for the authors.Why the authors do not consider to use aminoacidic sequence to compute a protein model (e.g., by using gromacs)?Auhtors report that Actin was used as housekeeping gene. Do the authors have performed an efficiency test before using it? Do they tried to use otherHK genes?
Furthermore, I reccomend a text revision since some errors are present in the main text.
Line 124: generate instead of generateLine 267-268: Please, check this sentence. It ends with "then".Figure 5 caption: activates instead of activateLine 302: plant leaves instead of plants leavesLine 311: plant leaves instead of plants leavesLine 315: maybe a semicolon after "salt stress" is appropriateLine 360: remove the space after "assay"Figure 9 caption: measure instead of measuringLine 392: I suggest to change the sentence in the following way ".. to drive the expression of target genes.."Line 446: "...participate in salt stress"Line 448: check the word "redycing"
