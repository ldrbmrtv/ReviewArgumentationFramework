Reviewer 1 Report
Major corrections
The manuscript by Zhu et al., describes the cloning of OfSPL1 transcriptional activator from Osmanthus fragans, its molecular characterization, subcellular localization, gene-expression, trans-activation in tobacco cells and two-hybrid system, and overexpression in Arabidopsis, displaying and enhanced salt-tolerance phenotype and protection from oxidative damage. In addition, heterologous overexpression promotes induction of several genes involved in tolerance to abiotic stress. Although the work is thorough, the Discussion is insufficient.  Also, the manuscript is poorly written, it should be substantially improved. Check English grammar and Instructions to Authors.
In line 227 “back of tobacco” is not clear be more specific.
Rephrase lines 266-268 is unclear; wording, grammar and punctuation are wrong.
Rephrase lines 317-318. Comments as above.
In lines 271-272 and 395-396, how do you explain that salt induced promoter trans-activation? Is there any published precedent?
Write appropriate brand of kits and reagents, followed by country. Check journal format.
