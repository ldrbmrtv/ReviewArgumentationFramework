Reviewer 1 Report
This manuscript describes a cohort randomized crossover design comparing cutaneous heat pain ratings and brain activity during heat stimuli after conditions of quiet rest and cycling in patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of Fibromyalgia (FM) and age and sex matched controls.  The methodology is sound and the manuscript is well-written.  The discussion interprets the results as supporting evidence of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) in the patients with FM.  However, the authors need to compare their findings to other research evidence showing impaired EIH and/or descending inhibition in patients with FM - especially considering that their results did not support EIH in the controls.  The authors merely mention that the exercise stimulus may have been insufficient for the controls to show EIH without critically discussing what such a conclusion would mean (eg, FM patients have better EIH mechanisms than the controls).  Also, the discussion section should be revised to acknowledge that many patients with FM would have been excluded from participation in this study due to major depression and medication consumption so there may be concerns about the generalizability of the sample, BUT the authors appropriately compared the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores of their sample to normative data and found no significant difference.  In addition, the authors might want to consider and mention that their method of controlling “physiological noise” might have influenced the results because cardiovascular reactions to exercise were, at one time, proposed to be a mechanism of EIH.

Specific Comments:
·         P. 1, L. 40 – I don’t see that the reference actually includes studies of activities of daily living so the authors should revise the sentence or add an appropriate reference.
·         P. 2, L. 18 – A reference for the determination that a dosage of antidepressants was “high” should be provided.
·         P. 3, L. 2 – Each temperature was applied twice so I assume the averages were used, but the authors should clarify.
·         P. 3, L. 15 – The time post-exercise before scanning was provided, but not the time post-quiet rest.
·         P. 6, L. 5 – “Elevations” should be revised to “higher” so that readers do not erroneously believe that a pre-scan application of heat stimuli was administered.
·         P. 6, L. 12 - I am uncertain why the authors only report the effect sizes of group differences for the first run.s
