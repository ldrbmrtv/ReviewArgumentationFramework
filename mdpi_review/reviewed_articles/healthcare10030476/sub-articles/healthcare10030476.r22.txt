Reviewer 2 Report
The manuscript has been greatly improved. I have one major comment. It is still not clear how thrombophilia was defined. You write (page 3, lines 129-130): "Only women with thrombophilia defined as a factor correlated with thrombotic phenomena linked to congenital or acquired factors. [21,40-43]"
I suggest you alter the sentence, e.g. to something like: "Thrombophilia was defined as either the diagnosis of an inherited thrombophilia, a personal history of VTE or a familial history of VTE." If that is how you defined thrombophilia?
Also, another round of language editing may be suitable.
