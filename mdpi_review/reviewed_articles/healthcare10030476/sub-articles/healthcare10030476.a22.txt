Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:Reviewer 2:
Point 1: The manuscript has been greatly improved. I have one major comment. It is still not clear how thrombophilia was defined. You write (page 3, lines 129-130): "Only women with thrombophilia defined as a factor correlated with thrombotic phenomena linked to congenital or acquired factors. [21,40-43]"

I suggest you alter the sentence, e.g. to something like: "Thrombophilia was defined as either the diagnosis of an inherited thrombophilia, a personal history of VTE or a familial history of VTE." If that is how you defined thrombophilia?
Answer to the Reviewer Point 1: The observation of the reviewer has been accepted and the table 1 was modified accordingly.
Point 2: Also, another round of language editing may be suitable.
Answer to the Reviewer Point 2: The new manuscript has been evaluated by an expert of English language.

We also declare that we have no conflict of interest in connection with this paper.
We sincerely hope that the enclosed manuscript can be accepted for publication in the: Healthcare.
