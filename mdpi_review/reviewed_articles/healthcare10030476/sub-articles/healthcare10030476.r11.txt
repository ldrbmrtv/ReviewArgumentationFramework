Reviewer 1 Report
Verolino et al. Present a manuscript comparing the clinical thrombosis outcome in patients undergoing abdominoplasty and being on LMWH vs anti-Xa DOACs. Overall, this is nice work demonstrating the equivalence in efficacy between the LMWH and anti-Xa inhibitor in respect to thrombotic complications. Authors, however, need to address the following concerns:
Have authors followed on the bleeding complications like epistaxis, menorrhagia, gum bleedings, etc.?
Authors mention there were 2 cases of hematoma in enoxaparin group. Please describe it further. Were hematomas developing paraumbilically? Or were they seen somewhere else?
Extensive English editing is required.
Citations needed for sentences in line 36 and line 37.
In line 89 authors state that "thrombophilic states are rather venous than arterial". Although this may be true from a prevalence standpoint, the way this sentence is structured would mislead the reader. Revise accordingly, since there a number of arterial thromboses that thrombophilias can cause.
In line 87 - authors state "mild thrombophilia". Severity of thrombophilic states are now yet well categorized, therefore more clarification needs to be provided here.
Enoxaparin and rivaroxaban have to be lower case as they are not brand names.
Line 150 - it should be "anti-thrombotic" rather than "an-thrombotic".
P values have to presented in Table 1.
Line 179 - authors first mention 39 factors, and then in line 179 state 40. Which is true?
