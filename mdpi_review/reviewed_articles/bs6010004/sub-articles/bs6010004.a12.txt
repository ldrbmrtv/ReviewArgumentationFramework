This paper presents results from a longitudinal study of sexual subjectivity in university-age students who were followed over the course of 1 year. The normative development of sexual health is an important and understudied topic, and the Introduction to this paper provides a good overview of the theoretical work in this area. I have four recommendations for improving the paper.
***Thank you for the compliments and the suggestions.

First, the attrition between Time 1 and Time 2 was substantial (40% of participants), and this is handled using list-wise deletion. That is, any one who did not complete both assessments was not included in the analyses. List-wise deletion can lead to serious bias in results. Analyses should be re-done using a more sophisticated method for handling missing data, such as multiple imputation or full-information maximum likelihood (Shafer & Graham, 2002, Psychological Methods).
***We have now used multiple imputation to maintain all 295 participants in all analyses.
Second, potential participants were "approached at a university campus" during orientation week. What percentage of people who were approached agreed to participate? How broadly representative of the university population (or the university-age population) is the sample? From the relatively high percentage of non-heterosexual participants, there seems to be some selection bias. At the very least, the Discussion should consider how generalizable these results are.
***We are sorry that we did not keep a tally of the number of students approached.  We have added to the Limitations section of the Discussion about this (see p. 12). It reads,
First, the participants in the study were predominantly middle class, Caucasian university students, residing in one region of Australia. There is also the possibility that individuals more interested in sex and relationships chose to participate. Therefore, the results of the current study may have some limited generalizability.
Third, although longitudinal data can be a quite powerful tool for understanding change and development, the current analyses squander some of that power. The regression results presented in Table 2 test whether sexual behaviors that participants already experienced by Time 1 predicted facets of sexual subjectivity at Time 2, controlling for sexual subjectivity at Time 1. Why would behavior that has already happened contribute to a re-ordering of individuals over the course of the next year? It seems that a more interesting and direct test of the longitudinal effects of sexual behavior on sexual subjectivity would test whether new sexual behaviors (that is, sexual behaviors experienced between Time 1 and Time 2) predict change in sexual subjectivity from Time 1 to Time 2. Moreover, the reverse paths -- from sexual subjectivity to future behavior -- are also not tested in this paper. More generally, I think the putative timescale of effects of behavior on sexual subjectivity needs more theoretical elaboration. Are behaviors in early adolescence (before age 16), for example, expected to continue to influence the trajectory of sexual subjectivity regardless of later sexual behavior? That seems to be the model implied by the analyses, but it is never explicitly specified.
*** We agree that this is very important. We have added the Introduction to expand on these points. Unfortunately we could not conduct these suggested analyses. We had very little change in sexual behavior given the way we measured it. Also, we did not have confidence in estimation of sexual behavior for those who did not participate at Wave 2, which could have increased the change.  Thus, we have maintained our original analyses, but make this comment in the Discussion (see p. 12-13):
Second, probably because the majority of the participants had already experienced coitus prior to the first data collection and because we measured types of sexual behavior and not frequency or some other aspect of behavior, there was high stability in sexual behavior over the one year of this study. Recent statistics show that the majority of Australian year 10-12 students (approximately 15-17 years) have engaged in some form of sexual behavior [12]. Therefore, in order to capture sexual subjectivity as it emerges and develops most rapidly along with change in sexual behavior, future studies may need to begin with a younger population.
Recently, Hensel et al. [31] found that, in their adolescent participants, sexual self-concept had a bidirectional relationship with sexual experience, and the same may occur for sexual subjectivity. Future research could examine the possibility of bidirectional relationships between sexual subjectivity and sexual behavior. In addition, no previous study has examined the timing of pubertal development and sexual subjectivity. Evidence suggests that adolescents that mature earlier, compared to their peers, form romantic relationships earlier and experience sexual behaviors earlier [11,55]. In the current and past research, the link between age and sexual subjectivity has been relatively weak [34]. Substituting timing of pubertal status for age may provide more evidence regarding individual characteristics that influence differences in sexual subjectivity and its development over time.

Fourth, each analysis is conducted for each subscale separately, but (with the exception of sexual body-esteem) the scales are consistently (if moderately) intercorrelated. I think it would be informative to test whether associations with age or sexual experience group are operating through a general underlying factor of sexual subjectivity versus are unique to specific facets. The shift to a latent factor approach would have the added benefit of allowing the authors to use FIML to account for missing data at T2, and they could thus use their entire sample.
***We have trimmed the paper to focus on two of the five elements of sexual subjectivity and anticipated that these two elements would show different results. Thus, we have maintained the separate analyses of these two elements. Please see the added Hypotheses on p. 5-6.
Fifth, one set of results seems quite contradictory: sense of entitlement to sexual self-pleasure decreased, on average, from Time 1 to Time 2, but sense of entitlement to sexual self-pleasure was positively correlated with age. How do the authors make sense of these result, as participants are one year older at Time 2? This contradiction underscores my concern about attrition (point #1); I wonder if the seeming decrease from Time 1 to Time 2 is an artifact of attrition.
***We have removed these analyses from the paper in an attempt to reduce the number of analyses and streamline the entire paper.
Finally, on a selfish note, I wrote an extensive review piece on this topic (Harden, 2014, "A Sex-Positive Framework for Reseach on Adolescent Sexuality" in Perspectives on Psychological Science), and I would, of course, be happy if the authors included a reference to my paper in their Introduction or Discussion.
***Thank you for this suggestion. The reference has been added to the paper.
