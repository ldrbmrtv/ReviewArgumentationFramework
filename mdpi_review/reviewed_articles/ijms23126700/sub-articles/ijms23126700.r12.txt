Reviewer 2 Report

The manuscript is devoted to identification of the sequence requirements for protein translocation through a bacterial membrane. The authors considered the role of positively and negatively charged residues and their abundance on the translocation. The results are very interesting and the approach proposed to regulate protein secretion may have a wide application in research in biotechnology. The study was very well planned and performed. The results are solid, and the manuscript is well written. I have only minor technical remarks.
It should be indicated which positive residues are found in the supercharged regions of the proteins in Figure 2. This is important given that Lys is less harmful than Arg.
Contrasting colors should be used in Figure 2b,c to enhance visibility.
The nonexisting term “primary sequence” should be replaced by “amino acid sequence” or “primary structure”.
