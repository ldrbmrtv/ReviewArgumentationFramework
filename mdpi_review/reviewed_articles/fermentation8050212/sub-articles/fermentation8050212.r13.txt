Reviewer 3 Report
The main comment addressing the article improvement is the methodology applied for statistical analysis.
The appropriate methodology considering parametric assumption for normality and homogeneity of variances before data analysis should be applied. Later one-factor analysis of variance should carry out accordingly. The application of the Duncan test should be justified because it is less sensitive in this kind of study.
Figures 2a, 3a and 4a include photos whose resolution should be improved.
