Title: Study on the Antioxidant Properties Enhancement of Rice Bran by Mixed Bacteria Solid-state Fermentation

Overview and general recommendation:
The article entitled "Study on the Antioxidant Properties Enhancement of Rice Bran by Mixed Bacteria Solid-state Fermentation", and submitted to publication in "Fermentation", is within the scope of the journal and discusses an important topic. It consists of performing a solid-state rice bran fermentation using a bacteria mix. Furthermore, some bioactive constituents of water-soluble extracts and the antioxidant activity were determined before and after the fermentation. Thus, in my opinion, the current study is on a topic of relevance and general interest to the journal's readers.
The paper is overall well described. Since I have some doubts that I would like clarified, I recommend that a major revision be warranted. I explain my concerns in more detail below. I ask that the authors specifically address each of my comments in their responses.

Major comments
Sometimes the document is different to follow due to English issues. Examples: Page 1, Lines 9-11: "In order to enhancement the antioxidant properties of rice bran, solid state fermentation of rice bran with mixed bacteria was adopted and optimized fermentation technology."; Page 4, Lines 141-143: “In the morning (on set light), breeding 9 fishes interbreed 1h, embryos were obtained from natural spawning collection of embryos were completes in petri Dishes; Page 4, Lines 153-155: “AAPH group only added AAPH. Four experimental groups were added AAPH and 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 mg/ mL sample, respectively.”; Page 5, Lines 188-190: “The optimum sodium humate content was found to be 1.0 %, which DPPH free radical scavenging rate of 81.22%.”; Page 6, Lines 218-219: “The significantly less polysaccharide content of FRBE than that of RBE (P＜05).”; Page 8, Lines 241-242: “Schmidt et al. (2014) also found that ferulic acid content of rice bran water-soluble extracts significant improvements, up to 765 mg/g [16].”; Page 10, Lines 321-323: “At the concentration of 0.3 mg/mL and 0.4 mg/mL, CAT activity induced by AAPH of FRBE group significantly higher than that of AAPH and RBE.”.
Explain what FRBE is. It appears for the first time on Page 1, Line 17;
The hot water extraction conditions were tested before?
What do the authors mean by 24hpf (Page 4, Line 148)?
Explain what AO solution is. It appears on Page 4, Line 162;
Explain the role of sodium humate.
Page 6, Lines 217-218: Check the values presented in the following sentence: “As shown in Table 1, the water-soluble polysaccharide content of FRBE and RBE were 552.30±2.68 mg g-1 and 450.28±1.69 mg g-1 respectively.”, because they are opposite to the ones presented in Table 1.
Table 1: The number of decimal places of some constituents is excessive. Example: for polysaccharide content, I suggest writing 552+3 for RBE.
Why did the water-soluble phenolic acids contents increase after the fermentation?
Page 9, Line 280: Is Fig. 3b showing different groups of LPO rate, or is Fig.3a?
Page 10, Lines 306 and 307: check the 73.85 and 77.00 values. They seem interchanged with each other.
Rewrite the first sentence in Conclusions.
2. Minor comments
Page 1, Line 9: Change "tastea" to "taste".
Page 2, Lines 66 and 67: Write the microorganisms' names in italic.
Page 3, Line 124: Change "ethyl acetate reagents" to " ethyl acetate reagent".
Page 3, Line 124: What do you mean “oscillated for 10 minutes”? Is mixing for 10 minutes?
Page 4, Line 131: Change "flsk" to "flask".
Page 4, Line 133: Change "VWD detector" to "Variable wavelength detector (VWD)".
Page 8, Line 261: Change “FRB” to “FRBE”.
In the reference list, write the names of the microorganisms in italic. Some journal titles are registered in abbreviated form, and others have a full name. Standardize, taking into account the rules of the journal.
