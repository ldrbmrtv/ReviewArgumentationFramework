Reviewer 3 Report
This paper described the multi-parents introgression assisted by molecular markers. The content is informative, however, the tables should be reorganized and the statistical methods description have to be improved. Please see the suggestion and comments below.
L48-63: should add some citations on the first part of introduction.
L127: Please add the explanation of “boro season”.
The legend of supplementary table should be improved. Table and main text are independent, so the authors have to describe the table more carefully.
L562: the section of statistical analysis should add more details. For example, how does H2 calculate? Also please indicate the R version.
On Supplementary table S2, does significant mean p-value? Indicate DFF = days to fifty percent flowering. What is the “treatment”? What do the results on “check” mean? How did you analyze “control vs IL”?
On Supplementary table S3, similar questions as S2, please also explain.
On Supplementary table S5, what is “C.D”? How did you calculate those values on those comparison types?
Please re-organize the Supplementary table S5, I suggest use each ILs only appear one time and add one more column to show their PC groups. Then the table can be more informative and ease to read.
Please add the full name of abbreviations. For example on L203 “CD”, L211 “SES“, L228 “UBN“ and L332 “ICAR-IRRR”.
The last paragraph of results is about background selection. Suggest to add subtitle “2.2.8”.
Please add some gel pictures of the foreground selection markers you used in order to visualize the genotyping results and showed the polymorphism of these markers on gel.
L296-L302: the marker descriptions on main text cannot match the supplementary table S8. Also, what are those 27 ILs on L298?
L602: there is no appendix.
