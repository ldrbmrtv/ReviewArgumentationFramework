Reviewer 3 Report
The paper is interesting; however, it is not clear what the authors are trying to achieve with this study. The authors test a popular assessment tool using confirmatory factor analysis and finds that the model is weak. However, there is no in-depth discussion or recommendations that follow. In fact, the discussion needs to be grounded in previous research findings in regard to CSR/sustainability indices/assessment tools/initiatives. Unfortunately, I am really not sure what the point is here. Further, the hypothesis does not seem to be written correctly. First, it should be stated prior to the methods section. Second, currently it is descriptive. In other words, it doesn't state what the authors are trying to test in this study. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend publication unless major changes are made to the discussion section and possibly recommendations are added for future research and practice.
