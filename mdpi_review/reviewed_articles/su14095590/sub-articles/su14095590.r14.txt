Reviewer 4 Report
The paper is well structured and presented in a very meaningful manner. It definitely adds a value to the existed literature. There are minor corrections to be considered. This includes:
Line 169 page 4, studies [28] & [29] do not reference to any presented argument(s) unless the preceding para.
The word of Table in all text should start with capital letter (e.g. Line 199, L. 223)
Paragraph presented after Table 2 (page 7) is a repetitive content to what has been presented in the Table. It could be removed or move to footnote.
It is better to show the P-values in Table 3 rather than (***) although a note is indicated in this regard.
Very good practical recommendations and criticism to the B Corp certification have been presented in the last para. of section (6). No any future research recommendations have been suggested by the respected authors.
References list is well prepared.
