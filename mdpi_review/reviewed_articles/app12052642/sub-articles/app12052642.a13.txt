Thanks a lot for your encouragement and suggestion.
We have rewritten the conclusions and abstract, and added additional keywords.
The following sentences have been added in the first paragraph of Introduction to mention the base paper and the related work (more references have been added): "Finding suitable compliant joints [7] can be a key step in designing LEMs. Jacobsen et al. [8] first proposed the design concept of utilizing torsional deflection to obtain out-of-plane motions from planar structures, leading to a new group of compliant joints for LEMs called Lamina Emergent Torsional (LET) joints". At the beginning of the last paragraph of Introduction: "In this work, based on the design concept of improving the tensile stiffness of LET joints in Ref. [19], this paper proposed a DL-LET joint by fixing a layer of flexible H18 aluminum foil a LET joint. A theoretical model is derived for the DL-LET joint and verified by FEA and experimental results."
The references have been reformatted according to standard journal format.
We have added more relevant references in this version.
