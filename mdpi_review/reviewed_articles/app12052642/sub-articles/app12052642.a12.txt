Thanks a lot for your encouragement and suggestion.
The mentioned reference is focused on an analytical method for modeling large deflections in compliant mechanisms, while this work presents a method of enhancing the tensile strength of lamina emergent joints by using double-layer materials. As compared to Ref. [19] which focuses on concepts and demonstrations, this work mainly focuses on analytical modeling of one design concept and provides finite element and experimental validations. The following sentences have been added at the beginning of the last paragraph of Introduction: "In this work, based on the design concept of improving the tensile stiffness of LET joints in Ref. [19], this paper proposed a DL-LET joint by fixing a layer of flexible H18 aluminum foil a LET joint. A theoretical model is derived for the DL-LET joint and verified by FEA and experimental results."
As to the second comment, Ref. [34] has been new added in the reference list and the following sentence has been added at the end of the second paragraph of Introduction: "Ref. [34] made a robot using double-layer LEMs, which is driven by magnetic force. This paper further discussed how to adjust the motion by changing different parameters of the mechanism". The following sentence has been added at the end of Conclusion: "For future work we will develop variable stiffness techniques of this joint, and explore its application in a robot arm considering both kinetostatic and transient behaviors."
