Reviewer 3 Report
The paper presents quite an interesting discussion.
The case at local and regional levels are well developed, but the discussion at international level seems poor, maybe the authors could exclude this mentioned focus o the Introduction
I'll suggest a format review in the figures and their quotations, as well as the box and the table.
