Reviewer 1 Report
This paper has much improved, also because its scope is clearer.  I am still puzzled about the selection aspect of EGT, notably the specific roles of metaphors, open concepts and master signifiers play here (as objects and agents of selection) - particularly now NCS has been presented as a master signifier. But that may be for a later argument. Language is generally okay. The argument could certainly be presented more succinctly, and there is a need for a light language wash ("with the? coevolution", "health care", "es"  etc....)
