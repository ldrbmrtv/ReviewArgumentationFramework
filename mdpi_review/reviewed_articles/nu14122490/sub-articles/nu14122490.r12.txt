Reviewer 2 Report
The authors have conducted a case-control analysis based on a large epidemiological prospective study and investigated an association between dietary nitrate intake and incidence of OAG.
The study has been well planned and performed. Chapter Material and Methods contain all necessary information. The writing is of perfect quality and the results are clearly presented.
The results and conclusions of this study are important.
I would only like to ask about one fact that I find intriguing. The authors have found that participants without OAG had a significantly higher BMI than those with OAG. Their mean BMI was found to be 27.1 kg/m2 which is considered overweight. Lower risk of OAG would be related to a higher total dietary nitrate intake. “Previous research has shown that a higher dietary nitrate intake was associated with significantly wider retinal arterioles.[46] Widening of retinal arteriolar caliber is not only associated with lower risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [47,48], but also with lower risk of glaucoma”. On the other hand, “compared with individuals with a normal BMI (defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), lifetime risks for incident CVD [cardiovascular disease] were higher in middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups” Khan SS, Ning H, Wilkins JT, et al. Association of Body Mass Index With Lifetime Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Compression of Morbidity. JAMA Cardiol. 2018;3(4):280–287. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2018.0022
I wonder if the authors could comment on this in the Discussion.
