Reviewer 2 Report
The authors present an experimental study of nano-scale defects in CL-20 under heating. Some changes in propagation of pores caused by both the phase transitions and temperature were observed by an appropriate experimental technique. Overall, the work is done well and manuscript sounds. Thus, I can recommend it for publication after a minor revision. In the introduction, the authors foreground their work, focusing on the relationship between the presence of pores and sensitivity. It indeed the case, but I could not find any discussion on this issue. Therefore, I suggest include some comments on this and, probably, provide some discussion of how to avoid the increase of such defects, which increase sensitivity of energetic crystals, in particular CL-20.
