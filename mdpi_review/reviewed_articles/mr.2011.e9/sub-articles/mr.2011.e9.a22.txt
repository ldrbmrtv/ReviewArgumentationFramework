Author Response
As for Figure 4A and 6C, the authors probably misunderstood my remark.  In fact the first version of these figures was OK with the y-scale  representing powers of ten. I simply suggested to add minor ticks  representing the subdivisions 2 to 9 between powers of ten, so as to  emphasize the logarithmic scale (in GraphPad, just click on  menu “format axes” and chose “minor ticks”).
Response: We apologized for misunderstood this reviewer's comment in previous response. Revision has been made in current revised version.
Lines 293-307 and discussion. The authors could devote at least a  line or a sentence of the discussion section to the interactions of PB2  with NEP and NP.
Response: We agree with this reviewer's comment and have included a discussion to integrate PB2 with NEP and NP and added additional references in the revised version.
