Reviewer 2 Report
Dear Editor,
I read with pleasure the article by A Dahan et al on “pathological analysis of encased resected RLN in locally invasive thyroid cancer”.
The article reports on relatively rare, but very important clinical situations, the invasion of RLN with thyroid cancer. The data is very interesting, well analyzed and well presented. The results are very interesting and, to my knowledge, never presented in such a clear way with so many patients (52 patients aver 15 years, the largest published series of resected RLN because of cancer invasion).
The limitations are clearly mentioned: of course the readers would like to have more informations on the functional follow-up of those patients (nerve reconstruction procedures, medialization procedures, voice outcomes, etc…) but the data is not available. As the authors have a large experience in this area, they could perhaps add a short paragraph on their current practice when they resect the nerve (reconstruction with ansa cervicalis when the distal part is visible, no reconstruction if the distal part is not visible but with early ?  late ? medialization, which type ? only if patients are symptomatic ? etc…)


Minor comments:
Lines 52 + 53, the authors refer to Fig 1 with the wording “epineurium”. This wording is not clearly mentioned in the Fig 1 legend. I would use the same wording in the text and in the Fig legend for clarity. In the text, I wonder whether the grammar is correct “ … the presence of tumor cells or stroma IN BEYOND the outer….”Perhaps ok, Im’ not native English speaker !
Line 140: spelling mistake “…and UTLINE the multiple…
Line 176, seplling mistake “…The 2018 INERNATIONAL..Neuromonitoring…”
