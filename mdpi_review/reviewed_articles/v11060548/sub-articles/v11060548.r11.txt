Reviewer 1 Report
In this study the authors examine the localization of IFITM3 during a viral infection in airway epithelial cells. They convincingly shown that IFITM3 clusters in cells where NP is primarily in the cytoplasm in an interferon dependent manner. Using super-resolution microscopy the authors show colocalization of IFITM3 with influenza viral nucleoprotein and early endosomal proteins. Overall it is an interesting study, using sophisticated microscopy techniques to examine the intracellular distribution of IFITM3 during viral infection. There are few clarifications that would strengthen the overall manuscript.
1.    The largest concern is regarding the colocalization of IFITM3 and Rab11A. It seems (as the authors state) that these represent abortive events (Figure 7). Therefore the inclusion of the movie examining the colocalization of Rab11A GFP, IFITM3-SNAP, and labeled virion seems completely unnecessary. In addition, the movie does not provide any details on cellular features and a viewer is left wondering where the foci are coming from and going. This reviewer suggests removing the movie or alternatively including labels on the movie of cellular features and including a scale bar.
2.    Additional minor comments on the figures include:
a.    Supplemental figures should be included in the main text.
b.    The NP stain in HSAEpCs is only shown to be cytoplasmic, inclusion of an uninfected control would demonstrate specificity of the staining. At later timepoints is the NP stain nuclear as expected, is this simply a delay in replication?
c.    Labels or zoomed out images from those presented in Figure 3 and 7 are needed to orient the reader to where within a cell the colocalization is observed.
d.     Figure 2B - Western blot examining levels of IFITM3 should include 24 hpi to correlate with the data presented in Figure 1.
