Reviewer 2 Report
The authors resubmitted the original paper with some improvements regarding the materials and methods, some lacking parameters in the population studied, but none real improvement concerning the BBB properties. Vigh et al. 2021 clearly indicated how the TEER measurements are experimentation and system-dependent and can't be set alone to define the BBB integrity. Moreover, the TEER measurements testify the ion fluxes, and even increased TEER values, the permeability for integrity markers such as sodium fluorescein of Dextrans is not proportionally alter and can be as low as the control conditions. Once again, the relationship between preeclampsia and BBB integrity is quite original, but poorly demonstrated.
