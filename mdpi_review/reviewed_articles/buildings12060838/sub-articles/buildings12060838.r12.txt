Reviewer 2 Report
I appreciated your efforts as most comments and suggestions have been implemented in the revised manuscript. The introduction and literature review sections have in fact been improved in the revised version of the manuscript. In addition, the schema added in the methodology section, however simple, can help to better understand the steps of methodology and application, and the revisions made throughout the manuscript make it easier to read. Finally, the English has been improved, but it could be further improved in the final version.
