Reviewer 1 Report
The resubmitted version of this paper exhibits major improvements.  Few notes for consideration here;

·         The suggested title on the response form fits better the scope of the paper, “Commercial Building Space Traffic Flow Design Based on the Post-Occupancy Evaluation”  maybe consider adding a case study given that it is clearly stated in the conclusion that the results are specific and may not be generalized.
Note that however the uploaded manuscript still shows the previous submission title. Recommend updating it.

·         Clarification of the concept, variables, and methodology have been well-enhanced. Minor text editing.
