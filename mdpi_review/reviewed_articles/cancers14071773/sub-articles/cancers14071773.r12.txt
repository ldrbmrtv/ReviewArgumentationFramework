Reviewer 2 Report
Previous studies in colorectal cancer have shown that MACC1 expression (which is associated with poor prognosis) induces cell migration in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo, and these effects can be inhibited by selumetinib. In this study, the authors have shown that the same is also true for gastric/esophageal cancer. The results are interesting and may have clinical relevance. I recommend the following edits before publication.
Major Issues:
[1] Figure 4 is missing. In the pdf I reviewed, the caption is there, but the figure is not.
[2] Abstract says 266 patients were analyzed (line 36), while result says 360 patients were analyzed (line 249). Please fix this inconsistency.
[3] Throughout the paper, 10^x wrongly displays as 10x (e.g. "105" instead of "10^5" in lines 152 and 170, "106" instead of "10^6" in line 217, "X2" instead of "X^2" in line 241, "108" instead of "10^8" in lines 353, 354, 365, 366, 367, 368, 370, 371).
Minor Issues:
[4] In Figures 3G and 3H, please specify p-values for untreated vs selumetinib in FLO-1/EV and OE33/shMACC1 respectively. If the difference is statistically significant, please briefly explain/speculate why.
[5] If possible, please use a higher resolution version of Figures 3F and 3I (the legends are blurry and hard to read in the current version).
[6] In line 306/307, please explain/speculate briefly why the control clone had higher MACC1 expression than the wildtype.
[7] In line 272/273: (i) please report median survival in each group (instead of mean survival), (ii) please specify Hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (in addition to p values), (iii) please report both overall survival result and disease-specific survival result (since you showed both in Figures).
[8] In line 274, please change "OR 1.51" to "OR 1.51 [... - ...]", i.e. specify the 95% confidence interval.
[9] In line 277-279: (i) please report median survival in each group (instead of mean survival), (ii) please specify Hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (in addition to p values). Same for lines 425/426.
[10] If the journal allows it, please break up the abstract into Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion. If the journal requires an unstructured abstract instead, please reorganize the current abstract so that the content flows uninterrupted (e.g. "MACC1 is an independent negative prognostic marker in AGE/S patients." should be after "Expression was correlated with survival and morphological characteristics." and before "To analyze the role of MACC1 in vitro the cell lines FLO-1 and OE33 were lentivirally manipulated." and so on).
