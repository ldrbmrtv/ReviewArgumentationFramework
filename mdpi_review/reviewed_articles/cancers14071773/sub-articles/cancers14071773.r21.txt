Reviewer 1 Report
The authors´answer regarding the cut off is sufficient, please include this argument either in the methods section or as supplementary information.
The authors refer to a data "Proliferation of FLO1 EV and FLO1 MACC1 over 72 h", however I couldn´t find the figure either in the manuscript file or here in the answer.
