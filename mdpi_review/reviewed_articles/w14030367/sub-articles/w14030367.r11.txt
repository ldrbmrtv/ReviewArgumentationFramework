Reviewer 1 Report
The paper is interesting.I recommend publication only if the following issues can be addressed.
- The innovation of this research needs to be better explored.
- Lines 33-38: You should mention that discharge of PPCPs degrades water quality and thus it cannot be directly used for potable water (via desalination) and industrial applications. Cite the following references:

- How many replications you performed for your experiments?
- Conclusion: Discuss the applicability of your findings/results and future study in this field.
- Conclusion: Make it as one or two paragraphs.
- Language editing is recommended.
- Table 1: What is the salinity (in mg/L) of the samples ?
