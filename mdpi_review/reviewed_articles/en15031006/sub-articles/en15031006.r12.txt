- Authors should avoid using the Subjective pronoun “ we” in academic works.- In such a study an experimental case must be presented in a specified region. -The authors should carefully distinguish the new contributions of their work from the new existing studies.for example: DOI: 10.1016/j.est.2020.101221 A comprehensive deeper literature review is necessary to address the research issue. Also, authors need to provide a literature survey in an organized way.- All the figures need to be improved.
