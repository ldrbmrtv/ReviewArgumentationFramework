Author Response
We would like to thank the Reviewer for a very careful reading of the paper and a number of interesting, though challenging, suggestions and comments. Thanks to his/her remarks, the paper has improved under many important aspects.
We summarize below our reactions to the points raised by the Reviewers following the same order in the lists of comments. In general, we amended the paper in accordance with the replies below.
Data issue: The authors indicate their data source as “…an index of panel data on agricultural output and employment in the first sector of 287 prefectures from 2000 to 2010 is collected from the China city Statistical Yearbook (2001-2011)...” It is not clear what kind of index the authors are referring to. Are the annual agricultural output data are measured in their nominal value (at current price) or in real value (at constant price)? If it’s based on the real value then what kind of deflators are used in the estimation, national level or regional level since agricultural prices may vary across regions? Labor productivity needs to be measured using real value of agricultural output. Otherwise, it may reflect the changes in prices instead of productivity. This issue needs to be properly addressed.
-          We better specify the required items on agricultural labor productivity in the text. Sorry for the unclearness. The index is actually the measure of agricultural labor productivity, which is calculated by the agricultural output and labor. We now clarify this part with another way of expression. The agricultural output is deflated with the base year 2000. There is no price index at the prefectural level. For this reason we use the provincial price indices to deflate the nominal series. Hence, all the prefectures within each province are deflated by the same index. Although suboptimal, this helps to preserve the comparability in the two estimations.
Literature discussion: Most of the literature cited in the Introduction section and Discussion section are published five years ago. The authors may want to have some brief discussion on more recent literature regarding China’s productivity estimates and policy related issues.
-          The Reviewer raises a very valuable point. We would like to thank the Reviewer to recommend us to develop this part. We now include more recent literature in the introduction, as well as the government movements of the relevant policies in recent years.
Measurement issue: The authors rely on the Latent Growth Curve Modeling technique to study the trend growth of China’s agricultural labor productivity. It is not clear, however, why the authors rely on a dataset with only 10-year period to discuss labor productivity trend growth issue instead of using a dataset with longer time period if data is available. In addition, the authors may want to justify their approach by briefly discussing the advantage or shortcomings of their method comparing to other approaches in identifying the growth trend of China’s agricultural labor productivity.
-          The Reviewer raises an interesting point that we overlooked previously. We take the starting year as 2000 is mainly because of the entry of WTO, which influences the pattern of agricultural production in China. We take the reviewer’s advice, to extend the time period until 2013, which is the latest available data on prefectural level.
Specific Comments
Please double check the citations and the references list as some citations are not included in the references.
Table 1: The title of column 2 is not clear. The numbers in that column seem to be cumulative proportions of total changes over time. Please be more specific.
Table 3: Each column title needs to be more specific.
Figure 3: It is not clear what the axis labels represent in figure 3. It needs to be noted.
Figure 4: Please be more specific regarding the range of slow, middle, and fast.
Appendix Figure A1: What is the definition of “absolute value” in this figure?
Appendix Figure A2: The figure presents the chain-linked index of output and input. It is not clear whether the output is measured in real value (at constant price) or nominal value (at current price). Please be more specific.
-          We would like to thank the reviewer’s scrutiny. We now correct all the issues in citations and tables and figures in the text. Figure 3 (now is Figure 4), the vertical axis indicates the growth rate of agricultural labor productivity; we now put it in the note. In Appendix A1, the “absolute value” means real value; we now change it to the better expression. In Appendix A2, they are measured in real value at constant price; we now better specify it in the text.
