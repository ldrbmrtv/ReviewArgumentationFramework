Reviewer 4;Author;1;10;0;The conclusion may be revised
Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;The BAC biofilter can remove the PPCPs, and then the following UF can reject micro-organisms and particles flowing out from the biofilter to ensure the quality of drinking water. The above coupling process makes up for the defects concerning respective operations of the BAC biofilter and UF. Although many pilot-scale setups were used to treat secondary wastewater effluent for water reclamation, this type of raw water quality was different from the river water, causing the different potential of biofilm growing. As far as we investigated, the lack of enough attention to long-term pilot study exists. Therefore, in this study, a BAC-UF system was carried out for several months with pilot scale to access the long-term removal performances and the respective contributions of BAC and UF. The innovation of this research has been clarified in the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion

Author;Reviewer 1;2;4;4;"Thanks very much for the reviewer. The conclusion has been revised according to the reviewer’s suggestion. The added paragraph in the revised manuscript is as follow:
 To sum up, the results show that the proposed BAC-UF system can be effective in the treatment of river water polluted by PPCPs, conventional organic pollutants and ammonia nitrogen. The two-stage biofilms located in the activated carbon column and on the UF membrane synergistically, can be conducive to the removal performances. Besides, the results of this analysis can have significant implications for the conventional UF operation procedure and the ozone-activated carbon process, providing a simple decentralized approach to drinking water treatment for the areas where source water is contaminated with PPCPs. However, the mechanisms of the two-stage biofilm, such as bacterial and metazoan communities, membrane fouling and dissolved oxygen transfer, should be further investigated to enhance the removal efficiency and stability of this system"

Author;Reviewer 3;2;6;6;Thanks very much for this comment. Biological activated carbon (BAC) combined the adsorption and biologic degradation consuming low power energy and chemicals without concern of DBPs production as well as no frequent updates for activated carbon media. The BAC biofilter can remove the PPCPs pollutants, and then the followed UF can reject microorganisms and particles flowing out from the biofilter to ensure the quality of drinking water. Thus, the BAC-UF process makes up for the defects of the respective operations of BAC biofilter and UF. Although many pilot-scale setups were used to treat secondary wastewater effluent for water reclamation, this type of raw water quality was different from the river water, causing the potential of biofilm growing differently. As far as we investigated, the lack of enough attention to long-term pilot study is present. Therefore, in this study, a BAC-UF system was carried out for several months with a pilot scale

Author;Reviewer 3;2;15;15;"Thanks very much for this comment. The comparison of previous research with existing research findings was added in the final part of the results and discussion. The added paragraph is as follows:
 PPCPs risks have been posing severe challenges to the safety of drinking water supply in rural areas due to the absence of the process with simple operation and maintenance as well as reliable performance. In this study, BAC coupling gravi-ty-driven UF was performed continuously, and the rejection performance of mem-brane filtration and BAC filtration both showed barriers for the conventional pollu-tants and PPCPs. Furthermore, this study indicated the respective contributions of BAC and UF, showing the role of the two-stage biofilm. Previous works involving BAC generally combined the ozonation with the BAC filter for treating the contaminants of emerging concern, eliminating a majority of PPCPs by more than 90% [34]. However, the regulation and maintenance of machines for ozone products are complicated, and the disinfection by-products will be newly generated in the effluent, which is incon-venient to use in rural areas [35]. In general, coagulation, filtration and single BAC units worked inefficiently and removed the detected PPCPs by less than 50%, as they were not hydrophobic [34, 36]. Hybrid membrane processes such as inline dosing of powdered activated carbon (PAC) prior to UF have already shown promising potential for the abatement of PPCPs; however, the inline dosing PAC is infeasible in rural areas [37]. In this study, the BAC prior to UF enhanced the biological activity by forming a two-stage biofilm system. Therefore, the integrated BAC-UF process can be considered as an economically and technically feasible approach to the decentralized and emer-gency drinking water treatment"

Author;Reviewer 4;2;4;4;"We are very sorry for the confusion caused to the reviewers, the sentences have been revised from the words and Grammarly. The revised sentences are shown below:
 Ultrafiltration (UF) as an emerging alternative technology to conventional water treatment processes, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, col-loids, bacteria, and viruses, thus reducing the risk of water-borne diseases [10]. Size exclusion is considered the primary removal mechanism for the UF. However, in the case of the PPCPs with a small molecular weight (typically < 600 Da), UF membranes also cannot effectively reject these PPCPs, but nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are able to remove these PPCPs based on the thin-film composite [11, 12]."
Author;Reviewer 4;2;5;5;Thanks very much for this comment. The t-test results have been added in the revised Table1
Author;Reviewer 4;2;6;6;Thanks very much for this comment. The same trend (Figure 2) was mainly due to the stable removal ability of BAC and UF for organics, causing the removal restriction. The periodic backwash (7days) of BAC caused sometimes the dissolved oxygen concentration of BAC-effluent higher than that of raw water. After the gas scrubbing and the hydraulic backwashing, the dissolved oxygen detection of the effluent was carried out, resulting in the above results for dissolved oxygen. Besides, the t-test was used and proved the significant difference between BAC-Effluent and BAC/UF-effluent

Author;Reviewer 4;4;3;3;"Thanks to this reviewer for the comment. Common waterborne viruses include Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, Poliovirus, adenovirus, and coxsackie virus, with sizes of 26 nm, 27 nm, 30 nm, 90 nm, and 30 nm, respectively [1-5]. The molecular weights of PPCPs are generally less than 1000 Da (about 1-2 nm), obviously smaller than the virus. The molecular weight cut off of UF membranes was an average 100 000 Da in this work, which was similar to the virus but larger than the PPCPs molecules.

Author;Reviewer 4;4;4;4;"Thanks for the kind reminder. The information regarding the biological degradation of PPCPs has been added in the introduction. The revised sentences are shown below:
 In the BAC biofilters, the biotransformation and adsorption both contributed to the PPCPs removal. The activated carbon adsorbed PPCPs to the surface and interior, where microorganisms were suitable for growth. Under the long-term effect of high-concentration PPCPs, the dominant microorganisms in the biofilter were selected to survive. These microorganisms mostly transformed PPCPs into many segments and even directly mineralized them to CO2 [3, 14]."

The PPCPs sludge at the bottom of the river never executes removal. Thanks for the suggestion from the reviewer. We will further precipitate the PPCPs sludge before the water treatment plant or excavate the PPCPs sludge from the river and study the effects on drinking water quality. The relevant results will be published in another paper in the future
