Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;To my deep regret the structural characteristic of EPS is the weak point of this publication. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy data can only be regarded as preliminary. According to the 1H NMR spectrum, it can be assumed that EPS has a complex branched structure. Probably, to establish its structure, it is necessary to use chemical methods (hydrolysis, methylation, etc.), as well as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;EPC is isolated from a thermal spring of volcanic origin, which contains a set of various elements, including heavy metals. It is advisable, in my opinion, to provide information on the content of heavy metals in the EPS, since the authors plan to offer this product for the food industry in the future
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;"Line 42: It is premature to include the term ""structure"" in keywords at this stage."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;Line 526-527: The proposal should be reformulated. According to Figure 7. the activity of the ascorbic acid is higher than the activity of EPS produced by CamB6.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;To better understand EPS chemical structure, further 2D NMR experiments were performed and results are presented inside the manuscript. In short, they allow to clearly identify the D-mannose α-(1→2) and α-(1→4) linkages in EPS. These results suggest they are the prevailing units of the EPS backbone making it a branched one. Also, β-glucopyranose and β-galactopyranose structures were identified and the acetylation was confirmed.

Author;Reviewer_1;2;36;36;This is a heteropolysaccharide composed of 3 different sugars as determined for HPLC, which is highly common in this kind of polysaccharides isolated from bacterial strains (10.3390/foods11020156)
Author;Reviewer_1;2;37;36;There are several earlier report where different concentration of yeast extract is added to the culture media for optimized EPS production, and the resultant EPS also concisted of mannan. However, there is no report that the mannan came from yeast extract (DOI: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.139, DOI: 10.1023/B:WIBI.0000033068.45655.2a). The same applies for our study too. In addition, the yeast mannan have β-(1→4) linkage and the one found in this work have α-linkage type. This allows us to conclude they are different polysaccharides.

Author;Reviewer_2;2;51;2;According to the composition of EPS no metal was found to be attached with the structure of purified EPS. Likewise, in this study the monomeric composition was analysed to demonstrate the structure of purified EPS, where no metal was found to be attached with the chemical structure of it.

Author;Reviewer_2;2;53;4;Thank you so much dear reviewer for mentioning this point. The correction has been made now in the revised version of the manuscript.
Reviewer_1;Author;3;1;0;The English language was improved, but there are still errors.
Reviewer_1;Author;3;2;0;The following comments were not addressed correctly:
Reviewer_1;Author;3;3;0;Why was linkage analysis not performed? (I was referring to the chemical method by methylation.). Bacterial EPSs are normally composed of repeating units. Based on the 1H NMR spectrum, the purity and/or heterogeneity of the EPS is questioned. (I was referring to peak intensities that are not uniform.
Reviewer_1;Author;3;4;0;The new spectra emphasize this even more: for example, I count at least 10 H1/H2 cross peaks of different intensities on the COSY.) The authors added a COSY spectrum but did not analyze it.
Reviewer_1;Author;3;5;0;They deleted erroneous information about mannose residues, but came up with new conclusions about mannose identity and linkages based solely on chemical shift of anomeric proton/carbon.The information contained in the other 2D spectra was not exploited to provide structural information. Chemical shift similarity is not sufficient to identify monosaccharide and linkage in a polysaccharide repeating unit. The evidences for the partial structure given are not convincing. If the authors do not add methylation analysis and perform full NMR spectral analysis, the claims about structure determination should be removed from the manuscript.
Reviewer_2;Author;3;1;0;The authors took into account the comments of the reviewer and significantly improved the article.

Author;Reviewer_1;4;18;2;Your mention of the non-uniform peak intensity confirming the three different sugar units found. This is because the signal intensity of NMR peaks is related to an -H abundance. Different monomer ratios are responsible for this variation and support our findings. Also, the 10 H1/H2 cross peaks observed in the COSY spectra supported our findings of EPS heterogeneity, given the following facts: 1) We found 3 different types of sugars by HPLC. 2) We identified by NMR at least 2 types of linkages α 1-2 Man-Man and alfa 1-4 Man-Man monosaccharides. 3) There are other 2 sugars for which the β-type of linkage was identified but not the exact sugar position. 4) Anomeric protons shifts from units at the reducing end of polysaccharide differs from the one in another position. In conclusion, there are different linkage possibilities (plus already identified) to different monosaccharides in different ring positions. This gives rise to a multiplicity of signals (not fully identified in this work), which could produce different H1/H2 correlations
Author;Reviewer_1;4;19;3;Your mention of the non-uniform peak intensity confirming the three different sugar units found. This is because the signal intensity of NMR peaks is related to an -H abundance. Different monomer ratios are responsible for this variation and support our findings.

Author;Reviewer_1;4;30;2;Finally, we kindly request the reviewer to consider that this is the first approach to studying a Chilean hot spring EPS isolation and its functional characterization. We also mention that further work to fully reveal this EPS structure will be necessary using higher resolution NMR spectra combined with chemical techniques. This work has given partial structural elucidation, which can be considered a previous background for other research on this topic.
