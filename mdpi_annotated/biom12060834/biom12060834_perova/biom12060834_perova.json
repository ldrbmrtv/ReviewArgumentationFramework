      "Author.4.17": "The HPLC and NMR results from the present work confirmed the heterogeneity of the EPS (3 different sugar moieties with different molar ratios), which agrees with the other reported mannan polysaccharides. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are comparable with literature reports of other similar EPS or oligosaccharides, where complex structures are identified by NMR too (Casillo et al.,\r\n 2021; Chatterjee et al; 2018). Besides, our 2D-NMR analysis supported EPS heterogeneity, identifying different types of monomer linkages. Casillo, A., Fabozzi, A., Russo Krauss, I., Parrilli, E., Biggs, C. I., Gibson, M.

Different monomer ratios are responsible for this variation and support our findings. Also, the 10 H1/H2 cross peaks observed in the COSY spectra supported our findings of EPS heterogeneity, given the following facts: 1) We found 3 different types of sugars by HPLC. 2) We identified by NMR at least 2 types of linkages \u03b1 1-2 Man-Man and alfa 1-4 Man-Man monosaccharides. 3) There are other 2 sugars for which the \u03b2-type of linkage was identified but not the exact sugar position. 4) Anomeric protons shifts from units at the reducing end of polysaccharide differs from the one in another position. In conclusion, there are different linkage possibilities (plus already identified) to different monosaccharides in different ring positions. This gives rise to a multiplicity of signals (not fully identified in this work), which could produce different H1/H2 correlations",
