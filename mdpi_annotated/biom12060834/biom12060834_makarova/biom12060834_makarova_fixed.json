(I was referring to peak intensities that are not uniform.\r\nThe new spectra emphasize this even more: for example, I count at least 10 H1/H2 cross peaks of different\r\nintensities on the COSY.) The authors added a COSY spectrum but did not analyze it.\r\nThey deleted erroneous information about mannose residues, but came up with new conclusions about\r\nmannose identity and linkages based solely on chemical shift of anomeric proton/carbon.The information\r\ncontained in the other 2D spectra was not exploited to provide structural information. Chemical shift\r\nsimilarity is not sufficient to identify monosaccharide and linkage in a polysaccharide repeating unit. The\r\nevidences for the partial structure given are not convincing. If the authors do not add methylation analysis\r\nand perform full NMR spectral analysis, the claims about structure determination should be removed from\r\nthe manuscript."

However, we would like to remind you that the \r\nmain purpose of this manuscript is not the complete elucidation of the EPS chemical structure but also \r\nthe optimization of the EPS production, and characterization of the EPS functional properties. At the \r\nsame time, we provided different chemical properties like: sugar identification and its molar ratio, \r\nmolecular weight, functional group analysis and thermal stability of the EPS, and this journal has \r\nrecently published other papers with similar or less chemical information on the EPS, for instance: \r\nKuo, H.-C.; Liu, Y.-W.; Lum, C.-C.; Hsu, K.-D.; Lin, S.-P.; Hsieh, C.-W.; Lin, H.-W.; Lu, T.-Y.; Cheng, K.-\r\nC. Ganoderma formosanum Exopolysaccharides Inhibit Tumor Growth via Immunomodulation. Int. J. Mol. \r\nSci. 2021, 22, 11251. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222011251\r\nFetsiukh, A.; Conrad, J.; Bergquist, J.; Timmusk, S. Silica Particles Trigger the Exopolysaccharide Production of \r\nHarsh Environment Isolates of Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria and Increase Their Ability to Enhance Wheat \r\nBiomass in Drought-Stressed Soils.

      "Author.4.3": "On the other side, we performed the 1D and 2D - NMR analysis as complementary information to the \r\nother techniques in the present work. Such analysis was performed to try to replace the traditional acid \r\nhydrolysis, methylation/acetylation and GC-MS used in glycoside analysis. On the opposite to NMR, \r\nwe do not have access to this analysis, and we could not find it as a service.",
      "Author.4.4": "The HPLC and NMR results from the present work confirmed the heterogeneity of the EPS (3 different \r\nsugar moieties with different molar ratios), which agrees with the other reported mannan polysaccharides. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are comparable with literature reports of other similar EPS or oligosaccharides, where complex structures are identified by NMR too (Casillo et al.,2021; Chatterjee et al; 2018). Besides, our 2D-NMR analysis supported EPS heterogeneity, identifying different types of monomer linkages.",
      "Author.4.5": "Your mention of the non-uniform peak intensity confirming the three different sugar units found. This \r\nis because the signal intensity of NMR peaks is related to an -H abundance. Different monomer \r\nratios are responsible for this variation and support our findings. Also, the 10 H1/H2 cross peaks \r\nobserved in the COSY spectra supported our findings of EPS heterogeneity, given the following facts: \r\n1) We found 3 different types of sugars by HPLC. 2) We identified by NMR at least 2 types of linkages \r\n\u03b1 1-2 Man-Man and alfa 1-4 Man-Man monosaccharides. 3) There are other 2 sugars for which the \u03b2-\r\ntype of linkage was identified but not the exact sugar position. 4) Anomeric protons shifts from units \r\nat the reducing end of polysaccharide differs from the one in another position. In conclusion, there are \r\ndifferent linkage possibilities (plus already identified) to different monosaccharides in different ring \r\npositions. This gives rise to a multiplicity of signals (not fully identified in this work), which could \r\nproduce different H1/H2 correlations.",
      "Author.4.6": "About the COSY spectrum discussion, only a minor and partial discussion is presented that can be \r\nfound below the Scheme in manuscript: \u201cIn the COSY spectrum, it was found its \u03b1-configuration by \r\nlow-field H-1 signal at \u03b4 5.34 and correlated with H-2 (\u03b4 4.0), H-6 (\u03b4 3.98 and 3.85), and H-5 (\u03b4 4.12) \r\n(Speciale et al., 2022).\u201d",
      "Author.4.7": "Regarding the TOCSY and HMBC mentioned in the methods, they are now deleted from the \r\nmanuscript, as suggested.",
      "Author.4.8": "Finally, we kindly request the reviewer to consider that this is the first approach to studying a Chilean \r\nhot spring EPS isolation and its functional characterization. We also mention that further work to fully \r\nreveal this EPS structure will be necessary using higher resolution NMR spectra combined with \r\nchemical techniques. This work has given partial structural elucidation, which can be considered a \r\nprevious background for other research on this topic.",
