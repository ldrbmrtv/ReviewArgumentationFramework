      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Especially in the results and discussion section, most of the content is to state the experimental results (correlation of data), while the discussion (eg. prediction mechanism, prediction accuracy, etc.) is not in-depth, and the analysis of model accuracy is rarely involved in the discussion.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "When the samples are grouped, it is generally carried out according to 7:3 or 3:1 or a certain ratio. There are 114 soil samples in this study, what is the basis for grouping by 88/26 (77.2%/22.8%)?",
