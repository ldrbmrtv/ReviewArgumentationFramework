Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;The definition of biophilia is described as an “inherent love” toward nature. While this is somewhat accurate, it might be more appropriate to elucidate this as an “inherent affinity”.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;"P1, L39-41: Please provide references to these frameworks. Reading further to page 3, I believe these are the 24 biophilic design attributes [ref. 25,39], and the 14 patterns of biophilic design [ref.40]. Further references around the biophilic concept could also be provided, e.g.:
 žBjørn et al., 2009. Biophilia: Does Visual Contact with Nature Impact on Health and Well-Being? International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
 žUlrich, 1993. Biophilia, biophobia, and natural landscapes.
 žKo et al., 2020. A window view quality assessment framework. LEUKOS.
 The latter reference reviewed many international standards that advocate nature and biophilic design for view and building spaces, with examples given to the Singapore context. This somewhat overlaps with my next comment."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;"P2, 47-53: Although in the past there were few guidelines, nowadays, there may be more standards that focus on nature integration within the built environment. WELL v2 has several features for Nature and Mind, and Biophilia – Parts I and II, with quantitative assessment methods provided. Similarly, the Green Mark system uses the green plot ratio, assigning credits to greenery provision to enhance biodiversity and visual relief. Other standards likely incorporate biophilic elements in building architecture and could be worth highlighting.
 
 The general issue raised by the authors do not necessarily imply a lack of guidelines for biophilic design, since there are several readily available, but may point toward prioritization or emphasis of criteria to meet certain varying expectations, which was alluded to on lines 52-53. If the authors agree with this, perhaps this could be revised here to reflect this."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;"P2, L63: Although I wouldn’t completely rule this out, POE surveys may not always provide feedback to the architect, since they are implemented post design-stage and the building would be operated by facility management or the owner. In my view, POE information had more utility diagnosing operation problems, which can be solved when running the building, identifying prominent sources of dissatisfaction that can prompt action to resolve these issues. Recently POE studies, also using office data, advocate this as benefit to their implementation, albeit not necessarily being the only reason:

Reviewer_1;Author;1;5;0;P3, L92: I think refers to “has helped” given the five decades predating this.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;6;0;P3, L106: While I generally agree with, questions could be raised to whether POE scales should be used to evaluate biophilic design evaluation. Biophilic design is known to elicit mental and physical health benefits, as stated by the authors on page 1, lines 29-32. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use psychological scales (e.g., PANAS or psychological restoration), instead of design orientated question or survey. If the authors agree with this, this aspect could be revised.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;7;0;Something I felt would useful would at the beginning would be a clear definition for what “biophilic attributes” refers to. Figure 1 provides some insights into this, but these listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent. This becomes an issue later, since some aspects referring to biophilic design become unclear.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;8;0;P4, L173-174: The authors state that seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded. If this was the case, then please better articulate its overarching utility in this study, considering that half of the patterns were not relevant to the research scope.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;9;0;P4, L180-183: In traditional POE studies and general building science research, daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, would be considered as indoor environment parameters (as examples, please see refs. in comment #4), while office layout and building form would be considered a physical and architectural parameters. Reading further to page 5, lines 189-192, the authors begin to suggest to this, but referred to them and others indoor environmental parameters as factors for the workplace. I would suggest better rationalizing the connections between the nine design parameters to biophilia to make these more overt.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;10;0;"Figure 1: The image presenting all the linkages is very interesting and is worth emphasizing, but contains an overwhelming degree of information, and the text and line sizes are too small for readership. Please consider simplifying the figure. For example, some text boxes many do not need further explanation (e.g., presence of water); also, the lines connecting column A to the same patterns in column 4 could be color coordinated."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;11;0;Table 2: Please consider providing further explanations for this table. It was not clear what the authors wanted to show.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;12;0;P8, L245: Please specify why these two offices were of interest (e.g., were they comparable or had specify architectural features worthy of study). If possible, please provide more characteristics (e.g., size, floor area, furniture layout (e.g., open-plan or enclosed), etc.) for each office. Later (P10, L299), it says 201 questionnaires were collected, with 161 occupants taking part in the Singaporean office. This led me to believe that this office was much larger than the building studied in China. An image showing the indoor conditions and outdoor façade for each might be beneficial. Many of the explanations found in section 3.1 could be moved into this part of the manuscript, since they many describe and show the existing office conditions and to do necessarily form part of the main results.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;13;0;Section 3.3. Although I appreciated the thoroughness to which the descriptive statistical was explained, I wasn’t convinced the mean was the best indicator for the data, considering that evaluation scores were collected on a 5-point scale and not a continuous linear one. In-lieu of the mean, please consider using the median and inter-quartile range as the central tendency and dispersion indicators. Figures 1 and 4 can be removed, as the assumption of normality no longer applies (also on P15, L399-400), or replaced with boxplots.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;14;0;"Table 8: Please consider applying benchmarks for what constitute reasonable levels for internal consistency, when using the Cronbach’s Alpha (e.g., α>0.7): Please see, for example: Taber, 2018.

Reviewer_1;Author;1;15;0;"Figure 3. The plot is well presented. A few minor notes for improvement: 1) Please consider adding short or abbreviated labels referring to the actual question, instead of codes (e.g., GH3-Q10). This would make it easier for the reader; 2) Round the percentages to the nearest whole number."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;16;0;P17, L434: Please correct the unfortunate citation error on this line.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;17;0;P18, section 4.2: Similar to comment #13, the data may be more suited to a Spearman’s correlation test, instead of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Due to the reasonable size of the dataset collected, it may not change the interpretation, but would help improve the analytical rigor.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;18;0;"P18, L448-450: Please check whether the sentence is accurate and correct the table caption numbers; I believe these should be Tables 10 and 11 and 12, not 1, 2 and 3. The sentence reads: Homogenous subsets with significant discrepancies (differences?) across subsets, leading to no significant differences across subsets. The above is not easy to grasp. If the information is accurate, please consider amending this to make this clearer."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;19;0;While the conclusions were well structured, I felt the authors could have highlighted more the main takeaway messages from their endeavors, in particularly the relationship between biophilic design and occupant health and wellbeing. This seems to be a core aspect of their work but did really emerge from the final section of their work in the same way it was emphasized in the abstract.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;1;0;"The introduction can be optimized appropriately.The introduction of the term ""Biophilia"" can be more detailed and easy to understand .By contrast, the introduction of “Biophilic Design”is very substantial.It may be better to find some literature to combine workplace design and “Biophilic Design”,and then to explore the relationship between them."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;2;0;The illustrations in the article are small and a bit vague,some pictures can shrink a little, not to the top to the border,these can be optimized.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;3;0;Overall work of the article is sufficient, the results is has the certain significance, but its limitation is obvious to all. Some of the results in the illustrations are obvious and can be reduced to less elaboration.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;4;0;The result of biophilic design frameworks for specific workplace typology is of certain value. The location of the workplace selected in this article is limited, the related biophilic factors are scientifically screened, and the researchers have made a detailed classification study. However, the huge research scope has certain obstacles to the relevant results, and the general and targeted conclusions will be worse.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;5;0;It is best to supplement and describe the necessity of research. At the same time, it will be more complete if the results are reflected in the summary.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;6;0;The object of the questionnaire should be composed of people with different ages and genders, which is best explained in the article.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;7;0;Adding some explanations, examples and data comparison to the conclusion will be more intuitive and convincing, just as discussed earlier in the article. Perhaps this makes this article more complete and credible. At the same time, the conclusion only summarizes the article, and lasks discussions and explanations for the future research direction.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;8;0;The theoretical part of the presentation is extensive, but the application part is relatively poorly described
Reviewer_3;Author;1;9;0;It is better to supplement the temperature, humidity and other parameters of the selected office in the part of the experiment, so as to facilitate readers' reference rather than just giving the location.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;10;0;The author can think about the impact of such a pro biological design model on the psychology of different experimental personnel. I think psychological factors will also affect human physiological comfort.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;"Thank you for your suggestion. The “inherent affinity” is more appropriate, and the term is updated in the manuscript.

Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"We agree with the comment. There are general biophilic design frameworks (e.g., the 24 Biophilic Design Attributes and the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design) and green building, healthy building standards (e.g., WELL v2 and Singapore Green Mark) that include biophilia into the certification systems in nowadays.
 And the issue raised by the authors is that these biophilic design frameworks (design guidelines or standards) are general design frameworks (design guidelines or standards) which can be applied to all building typologies (i.e., residential buildings, workplaces, retails, etc). Further research needs to be conducted to develop the design guideline specific for workplace. The sentence was rewritten to demonstrate this argument.
 
 Revision in Page 2 Line 56-61:
 “Although the importance of biophilic design seems to be well-acknowledged, and some international or regional green building and healthy building standards incorporate biophilic design elements into the rating system, such as WELL building standard version 2 and Singapore Green Mark [53]. However, further research on developing building typology-based biophilic design guidelines and assessment methods are necessary.”"

Author;Reviewer_1;2;6;6;Yes, the existing psychological scales are well-developed, but scales for investigating “workplace biophilic design” had not been developed before. Hence, in this study, we develop a method that focus on evaluating the biophilic design elements in workplace. The major scale of the questionnaire consists of three parts (subscales): general health (GH), nature relatedness (NR), and biophilic design evaluation (BDE). The questions in the first and the second subscales are referred to the validated scales--The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) and the nature relatedness (NR). The third scale is focus on evaluation on the biophilic design elements. Hence, the questions in the final section are designed based on the selection of the biophilic design elements/attributes that typically applied in the office design, which are not mentioned in the previous scales.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;7;7;"The method of selection of the biophilic design attributes/patterns for workplace is:
 ŸStep one, find out the correlated biophilic design characteristics from the two mainstream biophilic design frameworks.
 ŸStep two, we neglect the patterns which are not representative in office environment (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #8) and specify the selected design patterns to nine biophilic design attributes. The detailed process is shown in Section 2.1 and Figure 1.
 ŸStep three, verify the selection of the nine biophilic attributes matches the validated eight factors that affect workers’ satisfaction and productivity (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #11).
 In terms of the reviewer think that the listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent, we believe it is due to the research perspective of biophilic design is different from the perspectives of building science and traditional POE studies (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #9)."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;8;8;"The authors gave the reason after the sentence in Page 4, Line 173-174 of the original manuscript “Second, the authors neglect seven design patterns from the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design which are not representative of the workplace design.” to explain why the seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded:
 For instance, the patterns “Presence of Water”, “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk” (i.e., itemized patterns 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in Column B) are recommended but not demonstrative in this building typology (workplace). Those are usually applicable in other building typologies, such as hotels or residential.
 To further explain why these patterns are recommended but are discarded: 1) First, these design patterns (i.e., the seven discarded patterns of the 14 biophilic design patterns) are recommended because they are proofed that benefits health. 2) However, these patterns are not common in most offices. For instance, in most cases, the employers would not create an office environment that makes the workers feel “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk”. 3) Therefore, we only included those biophilic design patterns that relatively easy to apply in the workplace (e.g., greenery, natural light, artworks), and discard those which are not representative in an office design.
 And the sentences are revised to further explain the discard of the seven patterns. Please see the revised contents in the updated manuscript below:

However, these patterns are not common in most offices. For instance, in most cases, the employers would not create an office environment that makes the workers feel “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk”.”"
Author;Reviewer_1;2;9;9;"We believe that there is no conflict between the different classifications. The same parameters (e.g., daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, office layout and building form) can be classified in different classifications (i.e., the traditional POE frameworks and the biophilic design frameworks) by different perspectives.
 1) From perspective of building science, building performance, and traditional POE, these parameters (e.g., daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality) are considered as indoor environment parameters, and office layout and building form are considered a physical and architectural parameters.
 2) On the other hand, from the perspective of biophilia and biophilic design, (e.g., factors workers’ satisfaction and productivity), these parameters are re-classified and defined as the factors affecting workplace health.
 Both classifications validated by previous literatures."

 Revision in Page 23 Line 514-540:
 “The significant research outputs from the present scrutiny are shown as following:
 a) The authors develop a POE questionnaire for evaluating the biophilic design for workplace health and wellbeing. The investigation explains that combined literature review and POE results are one of the practical methodologies to establish biophilic design frameworks for specific workplace typology. And the questionnaire can be applied in future biophilic design research for investigation.
 b) Additionally, the study provides novel design guidelines for designers with emphasizing on weight for workplace design practices. The weighting results of this study would be especially applicable to the workplace typology. The 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design has a broader range of usage for all building typologies and is more suitable for general design applications. Therefore, the weighting results of this experiment are not employed to deny the ranking in the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design. These are exploited to show a new biophilic design framework for the workplace according to the users’ points of view (based on the POE results).
 c) Furthermore, the questionnaire results enhance our knowledge on the practical ap-plication of biophilic design frameworks for the workplace and contributed to more framework design consideration.
 d) The correlation results support the importance of biophilic design from the user perspectives. There is a significant correlation between office biophilic design and self-reported health of employees (r=.270**, p < .01).
 e) The study results contribute to provide designers with evidence-based design at-tributes for workplace design (i.e., the nine selected workplace biophilic design attributes).”"

 The Section 3 Questionnaire Results and Section 4 are rewritten in the revised version: a) the statistical analysis is modified; b) to reduce elaboration in the text. Please kindly refer the following revisions:
 1) The original Section 3.1. Observation Results-Biophilic Design Attributes in the Selected Offices is moved to be Section 2.3.2. It is because the 2.3.1 is the selection of office, and the Section 2.3.2 provides observation details of the selected offices. After re-construction, Section 3. Questionnaire Results focus on illustrating the questionnaire results.
 2) In the revised version, the formulars in Section 3.3 2. Quantitative Results of Impacts of Biophilic Design for Workplace are removed due to the statistical analysis is modified: 
 The means (SD) are only applied when the assumption of normality applies for the datasets. Hence, all the means (SD) are replaced as medians (IQR). And the corresponding figures (Figure 1 in Page 13 Line 359-361 and Figure 4 in Page 16-17 of the original manuscript) are removed in the revised version."

Reviewer_1;Author;3;1;0;For their response to comment #6, while I generally agreed with the authors, I felt that it didn’t quite address what I tried to originally convey. POE scales do not likely target biophilic elements in architectural designs directly, since a direct question (e.g. how satisfied are you with the biophilic features) may not accurately depict every beneficial nuance they offer (e.g. psychological recovery). Instead studies may elect to use, for example, other relatable scales, which may not have originally been designed for POE surveys (e.g. Mayer’s connectedness to nature scale) to help measure them. My generally feeling is that scales, from other domains (i.e. outside of POE studies) have been adopted for this reason, and a short sentence explaining the rationale supporting the lack of scales for biophilic design could be provided to briefly mentioned this.
Reviewer_1;Author;3;2;0;In consideration to their response #8, I understood and agreed with why half the seven of the 14 papers were discarded, but it did not provide much insight into why the Patterns of Biophilic Design were still used. A more useful example, which may have elucidated this more, was whether are there too few frameworks available, and/or none others could have been used. If this was the case, perhaps this could be succinctly mentioned.
Reviewer_3;Author;3;1;0;Figure 1 should be improved regarding the arrow.
Reviewer_3;Author;3;2;0;Photo in table 6 should check the copyright of these photo.
Reviewer_3;Author;3;3;0;"Please bring strong relevance to the scope of journal ""Buildings"" by investigating most recent literature."
