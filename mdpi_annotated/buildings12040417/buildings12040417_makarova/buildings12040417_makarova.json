      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The definition of biophilia is described as an \u201cinherent love\u201d toward nature. While this is somewhat accurate, it might be more appropriate to elucidate this as an \u201cinherent affinity\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "P1, L39-41: Please provide references to these frameworks. Reading further to page 3, I believe these are the 24 biophilic design attributes [ref. 25,39], and the 14 patterns of biophilic design [ref.40]. Further references around the biophilic concept could also be provided, e.g.:\r\nBj\u00f8rn et al., 2009. Biophilia: Does Visual Contact with Nature Impact on Health and Well-Being? International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\r\nUlrich, 1993. Biophilia, biophobia, and natural landscapes.\r\nKo et al., 2020. A window view quality assessment framework. LEUKOS.\r\nThe latter reference reviewed many international standards that advocate nature and biophilic design for view and building spaces, with examples given to the Singapore context. This somewhat overlaps with my next comment.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "P2, 47-53: Although in the past there were few guidelines, nowadays, there may be more standards that focus on nature integration within the built environment. WELL v2 has several features for Nature and Mind, and Biophilia \u2013 Parts I and II, with quantitative assessment methods provided. Similarly, the Green Mark system uses the green plot ratio, assigning credits to greenery provision to enhance biodiversity and visual relief. Other standards likely incorporate biophilic elements in building architecture, and could be worth highlighting.\r\nThe general issue raised by the authors do not necessarily imply a lack of guidelines for biophilic design, since there are several readily available, but may point toward prioritisation or emphasis of criteria to meet certain varying expectations, which was alluded to on lines 52-53. If the authors agree with this, perhaps this could be revised here to reflect this.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "P2, L63: Although I wouldn\u2019t completely rule this out, POE surveys may not always provide feedback to the architect, since they are implemented post design-stage and the building would be operated by facility management or the owner. In my view, POE information had more utility diagnosing operation problems, which can be solved when running the building, identifying prominent sources of dissatisfaction that can prompt action to resolve these issues. Recently POE studies, also using office data, advocate this as benefit to their implementation, albeit not necessarily being the only reason:\r\nGraham et al., 2020.

      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "P3, L106: While I generally agree with, questions could be raised to whether POE scales should be used to evaluate biophilic design evaluation. Biophilic design is known to elicit mental and physical health benefits, as stated by the authors on page 1, lines 29-32. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use psychological scales (e.g. PANAS or psychological restoration), instead of design orientated question or survey. If the authors agree with this, this aspect could be revised.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "Something I felt would useful would at the beginning would be a clear definition for what \u201cbiophilic attributes\u201d refers to. Figure 1 provides some insights into this, but these listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent. This becomes an issue later, since some aspects referring to biophilic design become unclear.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "P4, L173-174: The authors state that seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded. If this was the case, then please better articulate its overarching utility in this study, considering that half of the patterns were not relevant to the research scope.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.9": "P4, L180-183: In traditional POE studies and general building science research, daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, would be considered as indoor environment parameters (as examples, please see refs. in comment #4), while office layout and building form would be considered a physical and architectural parameters. Reading further to page 5, lines 189-192, the authors begin to suggest to this, but referred to them and others indoor environmental parameters as factors for the workplace. I would suggest better rationalising the connections between the nine design parameters to biophilia to make these more overt.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.10": "Figure 1: The image presenting all the linkages is very interesting and is worth emphasising, but contains an overwhelming degree of information, and the text and line sizes are too small for readership. Please consider simplifying the figure. For example, some text boxes many not need further explanation (e.g. presence of water); also the lines connecting column A to the same patterns in column 4 could be colour coordinated.",

      "Reviewer_1.1.12": "P8, L245: Please specify why these two offices were of interest (e.g., were they comparable or had specify architectural features worthy of study). If possible, please provide more characteristics (e.g. size, floor area, furniture layout (e.g. open-plan or enclosed), etc.) for each office. Later (P10, L299), it says 201 questionnaires were collected, with 161 occupants taking part in the Singaporean office. This led me to believe that this office was much larger than the building studied in China. An image showing the indoor conditions and outdoor fa\u00e7ade for each might be beneficial. Many of the explanations found in section 3.1 could be moved into this part of the manuscript, since they many describe and show the existing office conditions and to do necessarily form part of the main results.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.13": "Section 3.3. Although I appreciated the thoroughness to which the descriptive statistical was explained, I wasn\u2019t convinced the mean was the best indicator for the data, considering that evaluation scores were collected on a 5-point scale and not a continuous linear one. In-lieu of the mean, please consider using the median and inter-quartile range as the central tendency and dispersion indicators. Figures 1 and 4 can be removed, as the assumption of normality no longer applies (also on P15, L399-400), or replaced with boxplots.",

A few minor notes for improvement: 1) Please consider adding short or abbreviated labels referring to the actual question, instead of codes (e.g. GH3-Q10). This would make it easier for the reader; 2) Round the percentages to the nearest whole number.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.16": "P17, L434: Please correct the unfortunate citation error on this line.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.17": "P18, section 4.2: Similar to comment #13, the data may be more suited to a Spearman\u2019s correlation test, instead of the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. Due to the reasonable size of the dataset collected, it may not change the interpretation, but would help improve the analytical rigour.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.18": "P18, L448-450: Please check whether the sentence is accurate, and correct the table caption numbers; I believe these should be Tables 10 and 11 and 12, not 1, 2 and 3. The sentence reads: Homogenous subsets with significant discrepancies (differences?) across subsets, leading to no significant differences across subsets. The above is not easy to grasp. If the information is accurate, please consider amending this to make this clearer.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.19": "While the conclusions were well structured, I felt the authors could have highlighted more the main takeaway messages from their endeavours, in particularly the relationship between biophilic design and occupant health and wellbeing. This seems to be a core aspect of their work, but did really emerge from the final section of their work in the same way it was emphasised in the abstract.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "For their response to comment #6, while I generally agreed with the authors, I felt that it didn\u2019t quite address what I tried to originally convey. POE scales do not likely target biophilic elements in architectural designs directly, since a direct question (e.g. how satisfied are you with the biophilic features) may not accurately depict every beneficial nuance they offer (e.g. psychological recovery). Instead studies may elect to use, for example, other relatable scales, which may not have originally been designed for POE surveys (e.g. Mayer\u2019s connectedness to nature scale) to help measure them. My generally feeling is that scales, from other domains (i.e. outside of POE studies) have been adopted for this reason, and a short sentence explaining the rationale supporting the lack of scales for biophilic design could be provided to briefly mentioned this.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.2": "In consideration to their response #8, I understood and agreed with why half the seven of the 14 papers were discarded, but it did not provide much insight into why the Patterns of Biophilic Design were still used. A more useful example, which may have elucidated this more, was whether are there too few frameworks available, and/or none others could have been used. If this was the case, perhaps this could be succinctly mentioned."

As can be seen in percentage responses for individual items (Figure 2 in revision), most of the responses are distributed in the items \"Neutral\" and \"Agree\". The questionnaire results reveal that the employees from the understudy companies hold a relatively positive opinion on wellbeing, nature-relatedness, indoor environmental quality, and biophilic design for their health promotion. According to the arrangement, at the top of this, stacked graph are the evaluation of satisfaction of the work capacities and relationships in the workplace. About 73.2% of respondents agree that the workers of the companies under investigation are satisfied with their work capacity (GH3-Q10) and relationships (GH4-Q11). In the subscale nature relatedness, 62.2% and 61.7% of workers responded (agree/strongly agree) that their actions affect the environment (NR2-Q13), and they take notice of the wildlife in their daily lives (NR3-Q14). Nevertheless, only 47.8% of them selected agreed/strongly agree regarding the statements that their ideal spot for vacation would be a wilderness area (NR1-Q12). Regarding the POE results in the subscale BDE, 63.2% of workers agree/strongly agree that the natural light is an essential biophilic attribute and their offices are bright (BDE2-Q17). Furthermore, 60.7 % of the workers agreed that introducing natural colors in the office benefits workplace health and wellbeing (BDE11-Q26). More than 60 percent (approximately 60.7%) of respondents believe that greenery is a biophilic design that benefits office wellbeing (BDE6-Q21). Their feedback would be valuable for designers to note that application of the biophilic design attributes in the office design can enhance the experiences and evaluations of workers.\r\nThe quantitative results of the questionnaire survey demonstrate that the workers agree that the biophilic design attributes in the office have positive effects on their subjective wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2.

However, further research on developing building typology-based biophilic design guide-lines and assessment methods are necessary.

      "Author.2.19": "The Conclusion is rewritten to highlight the relationship between biophilic design and occupant health and wellbeing:\r\nRevision in Page 23 Line 514-540:\r\n\u201cThe significant research outputs from the present scrutiny are shown as following:\r\na) The authors develop a POE questionnaire for evaluating the biophilic design for workplace health and wellbeing. The investigation explains that combined literature review and POE results are one of the practical methodologies to establish biophilic design frameworks for specific workplace typology. And the questionnaire can be applied in future biophilic design research for investigation.\r\nb) Additionally, the study provides novel design guidelines for designers with emphasizing on weight for workplace design practices. The weighting results of this study would be especially applicable to the workplace typology. The 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design has a broader range of usage for all building typologies and is more suitable for general design applications. Therefore, the weighting results of this experiment are not employed to deny the ranking in the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design. These are exploited to show a new biophilic design framework for the workplace according to the users\u2019 points of view (based on the POE results).\r\nc) Furthermore, the questionnaire results enhance our knowledge on the practical ap-plication of biophilic design frameworks for the workplace and contributed to more framework design consideration.\r\nd) The correlation results support the importance of biophilic design from the user perspectives. There is a significant correlation between office biophilic design and self-reported health of employees (r=.270**, p < .01).\r\ne) The study results contribute to provide designers with evidence-based design at-tributes for workplace design (i.e., the nine selected workplace biophilic design attributes).\u201d",
