Reviewer 1;Author;1;1;0;In Figure 3, formate formula should be better symbolized as HCOO- instead of COOH- as indicated.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;1;0;"Lines 59–60: Instead of links, a figure (may be included in supplementary document) will be more 
helpful. The links lead to a non-English website, and also they may become outdated in year or two."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;2;0;Line 60: Link to NO2 concentrations shows temperature profiles.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;3;0;Line 118: Was the analysis done on all FNT-proteins available at NCBI database? Please clarify.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;4;0;"Line 40: Line 120: From the tree as it is, one can see that NitM from β-cyanobacteria form a distinct 
clade. However, NitM from α‐cyanobacteria are not grouped in one clade. It is possible that 
another outgroup sequence or different methods for alignment and tree construction will help. Line 
122: What methods were used for creating alignment and phylogenetic tree (for example, 
neighbor-joining)?"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;5;0;Was formate inhibition test also done on strains with nitM from CC9311, CC9605 and MIT9313?
Reviewer 2;Author;1;6;0;"It would be especially exciting to see the uptake of nitrite at environmentally relevant concentrations 
(less than 50 nM)? Considering the genetic constructs available, I was wondering if the authors 
have attempted such experiments and what were the results."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;p. 7, Figure 3, formate formula has been changed to “HCOO-” from “COOH-”.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1;"p. 2, Lines 22–24; the data at the website cannot be posted as a supplementary figure because 
of copyright issues. I will ask them to revise the figure using English."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;2;2;"p. 2, Line 24; I confirmed that the following website link to the data of nitrite concentration 
is correct. 
“http://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/kaiyou/db/vessel_obs/hq/2006spr/137e/index_line.php?id=no2”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;3;3;"p. 4, line 16; Six NitM proteins registered recently were added to Figure 1 and Figure 5."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;4;4;"p5, Figure 1; Figure 1 was reproduced by using the UPGMA clustering method instead of 
the NJ clustering method according to the suggestion of the reviewer, then, NitM from α-cyanobacteria 
and β-cyanobacteria form clearly distinct groups. 
“using the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) clustering method of 
ClustalX.” was added in the legend of Figure 1."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;5;5;"Formate inhibition experiments of the NitM from CC9311, CC9605 and MIT9313 have not 
been carried out yet."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;6;6;"We will consider the nitrite uptake experiments at environmentally relevant concentrations 
of nitrite (~50 nM) in the future. "
