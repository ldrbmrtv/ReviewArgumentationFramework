And changing the routine of the day is a well-known factor influencing the dog's welfare and behavior, including the occurrence of separation anxiety, so the above-quoted sentence should be deleted because it is untrue. The authors have hardly studied all the publications on how dogs behave when daily routines were changed, so the term \"first study\" is exaggerated.",

Think either way this figure would benefit a bit of context on why was included/what was showing in context of this study as currently info is a bit generic and didn't totally tie into people's working from home etc.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.12": "Line 366-369= I'm not sure it's totally fair to interpret this (the dog not always bringing toy when greeting them) as an anthropomorphic interpretation on the part of the owner- the anthropomorphic interpretation seems to be from authors of manuscript not owner? They do not seem to state dog is favouring them less unless text was omitted here.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.13": "I felt the discussion about changes in greeting behaviour as an early indicator was interesting and could be expanded.\r\n Some more detail on the application of the findings to practitioners/owners would be beneficial.

      "Reviewer_3.1.4": "1. That dogs showing SRB prior to lockdown were more likely to show it after. Suggests the behavior is fairly robust and dogs having shown it at one point continue to be at risk (without knowing what interventions were taken)",
      "Reviewer_3.1.5": "2. Can you address the dogs that improved between Feb and Oct? You report the number of new dogs showing SRB but can you report on dogs that went the other way? What was the actual # and %? This comparison seems essential\u2014if some dogs get worse but some get better, than the argument that changes due to COVID might bring about new SRB becomes weaker. It seems you have compared within dogs that showed SRB in baseline and other models for dogs that did not. Seems a comparison between SRB- (baseline) \u2192 SRB + (post lockdown) and SRB + (baseline) \u2192 SRB- (post lockdown) dogs is critical and missing.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.6": "3. One of the challenges in this is we don\u2019t know background rates of change for dogs with SRB. That is, would the same % of dogs changed (in either direction) regardless of changes in owner schedules? We might see some dogs become sensitized over time and develop SRB (or something else changes in their life to precipitate it), while others might habituate or their behavior undergo extinction. As such, we can\u2019t say for certain that these changes are due to changes in owner schedule. You note that the pseudo-R2 was small but I think you could go into more details and note the possibility that it was unrelated too. However, your results that the greater the change \u2192 the greater the new risk of SRB does lend support to the idea that this change in management might be a factor. I would suggest highlighting and discussing this outcome more."

There would be evidence for some behaviors, such as destructive behavior or defecation, but how would owners know about pacing or tail-chasing? This topic is not addressed until the Discussion section (line 395) but should be addressed here in the Methods and Materials section.

This information would have been interesting if data on the mood, stress level, general mental health of the owners had also been collected in connection with the pandemic and the links with dog behaviour have been investigated. But the questionnaire only asked how long the dogs had been alone and what they were doing during this time. Therefore, the detailed description of the pandemic is unnecessary and could be moved to the Supplemental material, together with Figure 1.",
      "Reviewer_5.1.2": "I think that according to the statistics, the strongest finding is that dogs who showed SRB in February or May had increased odds of having SRB during the subsequent measures which is not surprising.
