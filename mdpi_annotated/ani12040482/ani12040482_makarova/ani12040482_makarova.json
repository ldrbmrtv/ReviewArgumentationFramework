What was the actual # and \r\n%? This comparison seems essential\u2014if some dogs get worse but some get better, than the \r\nargument that changes due to COVID might bring about new SRB becomes weaker. It seems you \r\nhave compared within dogs that showed SRB in baseline and other models for dogs that did not. \r\nSeems a comparison between SRB- (baseline) \u2192 SRB + (post lockdown) and SRB + (baseline) \u2192 SRB- \r\n(post lockdown) dogs is critical and missing.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.6": "One of the challenges in this is we don\u2019t know background rates of change for dogs with SRB. That \r\nis, would the same % of dogs changed (in either direction) regardless of changes in owner \r\nschedules? We might see some dogs become sensitized over time and develop SRB (or something \r\nelse changes in their life to precipitate it), while others might habituate or their behavior undergo \r\nextinction. As such, we can\u2019t say for certain that these changes are due to changes in owner schedule. You note that the pseudo-R2 was small but I think you could go into more details and note \r\nthe possibility that it was unrelated too. However, your results that the greater the change \u2192 the \r\ngreater the new risk of SRB does lend support to the idea that this change in management might be \r\na factor. I would suggest highlighting and discussing this outcome more.\r\n"
