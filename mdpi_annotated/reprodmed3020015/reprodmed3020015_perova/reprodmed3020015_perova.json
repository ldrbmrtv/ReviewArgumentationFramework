      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "1) In general, the manuscript refers often to PGRMC1 expression or downregulation. These are fuzzy terms for proteins. It is much preferable to refer to protein abundance, and changes in abundance. Such changes may occur at the translational or post-translational level. Translational level changes can be due to changed levels of transcription, to altered mRNA stability (such as that proposed here for miR-98), or to altered efficiency of translation of a steady state mRNA pool. The authors are strongly advised to change from e.g. \u2018expression\u2019 to \u2018abundance\u2019 throughout.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "2) Additionally, the methods do not say that all results were repeated at least once, and that a representative results figure is presented. Therefore, the reviewer assumes that experiments have only been performed once. The entire set of experiments needs to be replicated to demonstrate reproducibility before it can be considered to publish these results.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "3) Line 24. AG-205. The authors must refer to the fact that AG-205 is not specific for PGRMC1, contrary to many citations in the literature (such as would be the case here, if uncorrected). Cite PMID: 34944026, PMID: 34680104, PMID: 32924377. Sensitivity of a phenomenon to AG-205 is consistent with possible PGRMC1 involvement, but does not demonstrate PGRMC1 involvement.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "4) It is also suggested throughout to use \u201cAG-205\u201d (the correct name for the reagent: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com cat#: a1487) rather than AG205 (often incorrectly used in the literature).",

      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "7) Lines 88-98. Cell culture. What characterization was performed to confirm the identity of cells as ESCs? In general, there is very little detail on these primary cultured lines. How long are they held in culture? Are they stored cryogenically? How are they re-seeded into culture?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "8) Lines 121-133. What percentage acrylamide were the SDS PAGE gels. For what length of time and at what voltage settings was electrophoretic transfer to PVDF? In what device?",

Downregulation of PGRMC1 During ESC in vitro Decidualization.\u201d This seems to be the next section heading, in which case it should follow a line break, and say: \u201c3.2. Downregulation of PGRMC1 During ESC in vitro Decidualization.\u201d",
      "Reviewer_1.1.14": "14) Lines 153-156, Figure 2. The result must be shown for at least each ESC cell culture (each culture or patient named separately) obtained from each patient to demonstrate that the described results are representative of multiple patients, and not potentially atypical results from an atypical patient. This result must be demonstrated in a substantively convincing manner.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.15": "15) Line 158/Fig. 2. The western blot (also Fig.3) result must show the entire molecular weight range (e.g. in supplemental data), including MW markers. PGRMC1 is known to be Sumoylated or ubiquitinylated and then degraded by the proteasome pathway, which lead to higher molecular weight species (PMID: 31067491). The latter could well contribute to alterations in PGRMC1 abundance cited by this study. It is important that the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway contribution be either quantified or discarded in well controlled experiments to justify the title of the paper.",

      "Reviewer_1.1.18": "18) Lines 164-172. This cell culture experiment also seems to be based upon just one primary cell culture, split into replicates. I am uncertain because the methods do not explain how the experiment was performed. Cell culture methods must be much more clearly explained so that the reader can reconstruct each exact experiment.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.19": "19) Lines 178-9. If PGRMC1 down-regulation is critical, it should be possible to perturb decidualization by expression of an exogenous PGRMC1 protein. This could be accomplished by making an expression plasmid encoding a codon-altered PGRMC1 gene, and cotransfecting this in a controlled matrix design with siRNA. If siRNA-resistant PGRMC1 levels are able to inhibit decidualization it would provide convincing evidence in favour of the hypothesis that lowered PGRMC1 is required for decidualization, and is perhaps even a trigger. A codon-altered PGRMC1 expression vector would cost just several hundred dollars from a provider such as Genscript, so the experiment is eminently achievable.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.20": "20) Notably, Fig. 4. lacks the western blot equivalent to Fig.3A, showing that siRNA indeed depleted PGRMC1 levels.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.21": "21) Critically, these figures compare the effects of two variables each, and therefor one way ANOVA is not the appropriate test. Assuming binomial distribution, a two-way ANOVA is required for these experiments.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.22": "22) Line 189-96. The paragraph describes a result showing that the results are independent of P4. However, the control structure of comparisons is incorrect. The simplest direct comparison would be db-cAMP/P4 vs. db-cAMP to permit the argument the authors are presenting. However, the effects of P4 in the absence of db-cAMP would also require control in cells without db-cAMP, +/- P4. The statistical significance of any result would be evaluated using multivariate analysis.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.23": "23) Line 207: \u201cThe miRNA target prediction database, miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org), was screened to identify miRNAs with potential to interact with PGRMC1.\u201d miR-98 is already known to regulate PGRMC1. The results of PMID: 22492871 and PMID: 21109987 MUST be cited here. This is not a novel finding.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.24": "24) The discussion must qualify the results of Salsano et al. who used AG-205 to inhibit PGRMC1. There was no control in PGRMC1 genomic/CRISPR KO cells (not si/miRNA KO) to demonstrate that effects induced by AG-205 were due to PGRMC1.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.25": "25) Line 261. mechanisms HAVE not (plural mechanisms)",
      "Reviewer_1.1.26": "26) Lines 261-262. \u201cIn the present study, we showed that microRNA-mediated PGRMC1 regulation during the process of decidualization.\u201d This is confusingly worded. Suggest change to \u201cIn the present study, we showed that microRNA-mediated the regulation of PGRMC1 abundance during the process of decidualization.\u201d (if this is what is meant)",
      "Reviewer_1.1.27": "27) Lines 271-76. This is very long and burdens the reader. Always make new sentences when possible. Suggest change to; \u201cFurther study is required to determine the relationship between miR-98-mediatd PGRMC1 regulation and pregnancy. Comparison of the miR-98/PGRMC1 abundance in proliferative and secretory phases of endometrial biopsy may contribute to the diagnostic prediction of uterine receptivity for embryo implantation. Furthermore, controlling their expression may support the improvement of IVF (NOT IFV) outcome. Define IVF at first use.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.28": "28) Lines 281-5. PGRMC1 (Hpr6.6) increased the rate of cell death (in a non-apoptotic mechanism) in MCF-7 cancer cells in response to H2O2 (PMID: 14523988). That could be discussed here in terms of mechanism.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.29": "29) Lines 286-287. Enunciate what kind of role(s) PGRMC1 may be involved in (up/down regulation, when, how?). Suggest observations that may be able to discriminate between different possibilities.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "In response the authors have made minimal changes to the manuscript, effectively restricted to rewording the title, and several minor text changes. Unfortunately, the authors have been unable to demonstrate the direct involvement of PGRMC1 downregulation in decidualization. Since this is the main publishable finding, the results as they stand do not merit publication. The authors mention technical difficulties in establishing ESCs that express miRNA-resistant PGRMC1. This may be due to stable plasmid selection conditions, which may affect the differentiation status of the ESC cells. It would be possible to introduce an expression cassette via a lentiviral vector at MOI 1. An inducible vector may be advisable, such as tetracycline, IPTG, or other available systems. Such vectors typically include fluorescent protein reporters, enabling discrimination between infected and non-infected cells in one plate, or population separation by FACS.",
      "Reviewer_1.5.1": "The inclusion of the model of Fig. 6 in the manuscript depicts the problem. This manuscript will be cited as evidence of that inconclusive model. The reviewer is not convinced that PGRMC1 level attenuation by miR-98 mechanistically drives attenuation. Cell biology is quite complex, and it remains fully feasible that PGRMC1 levels only correlate with the decidualization process. In the lack of convincing evidence, the manuscript should be rejected."

      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "The conclusion has been verified by other 2-3 articles, and the design of this study is not rigorous enough. It is suggested to add cell lines or normal endometrial cells for verification. If further mechanism exploration is carried out, the research will be more complete and persuasive."

      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "I requested a major revision including the use of miRNA-resistant exogenous PGRMC1 expression (altered codon usage) to demonstrate that lack of PGRMC1 attenuation will prevent decidualization. That new experimental result is what elevated the required changes to a major revision. The revised manuscript as presently resubmitted is a minor revision. This is a critical point because the very title claims that PGRMC1 downregulation is required for decidualization. This requires stronger evidence than that currently presented. Furthermore, the required experiment is technically not challenging. The authors could consider whether an inducible miRNA-resistant PGRMC1 promoter could be designed. The fact that PGRMC1 levels fall does not mean that low PGRMC1 levels are required. This may be only correlation. Before such a claim is published in the scientific literature, it must be supported by convincing evidence. Aspiration to clarify this in future papers does not merit publication of the present paper.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "Lines 142-3.\u201cData of cell culture are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments with at least repeated two times.\u201d Change to: Data of cell culture are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.

      "Reviewer_3.1.4": "Lines 263-267: \u201cBecause the effect of AG-205 and PGRMC1 knock-down on decidualization was common in the present study, these findings further support for a role for PGRMC1 downregulation in promoting ESC decidualization during the secretory phase.\u201d The reviewer does not understand the sentence.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.5": "There are two natural sentences here. However, as described above AG-205 is not a specific inhibitor of PGRMC1. [full stop, new sentence] Further study of PGRMC1 knockout on decidualization is needed.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.6": "The salient point concerning the ubiquitination events is that they are correlated for other proteins with proteasome-mediated degradation. Sabbir\u2019s results (ref 31) imply that this also holds for PGRMC1. The new text does not conceptually link PTMs with PGRMC1 protein stability, which is the only reason they should be mentioned. To be clear, protein levels can be mediated by altered rates of transcription, translation, or degradation. This new text should be discussing the possibility of the latter also contributing to the observed effects, as well as the effects of mRNA level that the paper pursues."

      "Author.2.7": "The primary cultured ESCs we used were confirmed immunocytochemically to be positive for vimentin, a marker for stromal cells, and negative for cytokeratin, a marker for epithelial cells (please see above figure). ESCs at early passages (between 2 and 6 passages) were used for the experiment. In this study, the passaged cells were used without freezing.

As you pointed out, PGRMC1 is known to be modified by sumoylation or ubiquitinylation which results in high molecular weight. The right panel shows the western blotting of PGRMC1. There are some higher molecular bands (white arrowhead) in lysates of ESCs, however, the band\u2019s intensity was not changed by PGRMC1 siRNA treatment.

      "Author.2.30": "As you mentioned, our description of ESCs isolation may be inappropriate in terms of the patients with genetical differences. ESCs were isolated from histologically normal region in the patients with leiomyoma (age 42-45). It has been reported that ESCs obtained from the eutopic endometrium of the patients with endometriosis showed impaired decidualization. Therefore, we should consider the possible influence of leiomyoma on the decidual response, but we confirmed that the isolated ESCs have differentiated into decidual cells in response to cAMP analogue and progesterone, as you pointed out. The information of the patients has been inserted in the method",
      "Author.2.31": "Because of the ethical difficulties of isolating ESCs from disease-free healthy women, we routinely used ESCs isolated from the patients in surgical cases. ESC lines are commercially available (T-HESC, ATCC) and maybe useful tool to investigate the role of PGRMC1 in decidualization, as you pointed out. However, the cell lines are also established from the endometrium of leiomyoma and immortalized by transfection with hTERT. Therefore, we believe that ESCs used in this study are no different than the above cells and cell lines in examining the role of PGRMC1.In the future, we plan to use several ESCs and their cell lines to clarify the precise mechanisms of PGRMC1 downregulation and decidualization.",
      "Author.2.32": "As you pointed out, we infer that downregulation of PGRMC1 may be necessary for decidualization to proceed. To clarify this point, we further attempted to overexpress PGRMC1 by introducing expression vectors into primary ESCs under various conditions using lipofection and calcium phosphate transfection methods, as you suggested. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, we were unable to establish ESCs overexpressing PGRMC1. In the present study, we found that not only knockdown of PGRMC1 but also functional inhibition with inhibitors promotes ESC decidualization in vitro. Furthermore, in a previous report, overexpression of PGRMC1 suppressed ESCs differentiation (Ref. 19). These results indicate that decreased PGRMC1 in the endometrium may be associated with accelerated dedifferentiation. As you suggested, we have changed the title significantly because further evidence was not available. We plan to establish a model of miR-resistant PGRMC1 overexpression using several ESCs cell lines to investigate the role of PGRMC1 in decidualization, and if possible, we would be happy to make this our next research topic.",

These findings suggested that PGRMC1 downregulation may promote ESC decidualization during the secretory phase.",

We have added the following description (page 9, lines 304-308). \u201dThese reports suggested that PGRMC1 protein levels can be modulated by changes in the rates of transcription, translation, and degradation. Therefore, further studies would be needed to clarify the possible involvement of the post-translational modification and degradation that may regulate PGRMC1 protein stability in ESCs during decidualization.\u201d",
      "Author.4.1": "We appreciate your review of our revised manuscript, constructive comments, and suggestions for improving the manuscript. We deeply understand the significance of the experiments using miR-98-resistant PGRMC stably expressing ESCs to directly prove the implication of the miR-mediated PGRMC1 regulation in decidualization. We are transfecting the miR-resistant PGRMC1 expression vector into ESCs cell lines to explore the role of PGRMC1 in decidualization but is not going well. As you advised, lentiviral transduction of the PGRMC1 along with fluorescent protein may enable us to effectively select the overexpressing cells without losing differentiation status in response to decidual stimuli. We have acknowledged this and suggested it as a topic for further research in the \u201cLimitation\u201d section of the revised manuscript following editor\u2019s comment (page 10, lines 336-348).\n \u201cLimitations: In this study, we proposed that miR-98-mediated PGRMC1 downregulation may be involved in decidualization, but were unable to examine the effects of miR-98-resistant PGRMC1 on differentiation due to technical difficulties establishing PGRMC1-overexpressing ESCs. miR-98 may not be the only miRNA that modulates PGRMC1 expression; therefore, comprehensive analysis of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation of endometrial PGRMC1 during decidualization is required. In addition, PGRMC1 can bind to various proteins, including receptors for epidermal growth factor [46] and insulin [47], cytochrome P450 [48], and serpine mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) [19]. Further, PGRMC1 may interact with proteins associated with endomembrane trafficking/cytoskeleton and mitochondrial functions in decidualizing ESCs [49]. Thus, we plan to investigate the modulation of endometrial PGRMC1 expression and the interaction between PGRMC1 and intracellular proteins during decidualization in the future.\u201d",
