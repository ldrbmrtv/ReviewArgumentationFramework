Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;The manuscript by Sharmin Akther Rupa et al, the manuscript has many serious concerns on the basis that it cannot be accepted in this journal. for example, 13C NMR must be 100 MHz not 400 MHz, value must be either ascending order or descending order (13C NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 14.82 (-CH3), 149.25 (-C=N-), 153.65 (Ar-C), 125.26 (Ar-C), 140.31 (Ar-C),159.11 (C=O), 130.04 (Ar-C), 112.83 (Ar-C), 109.34 (Ar-C), 123.05 (Ar-C). above example showed the manuscript not written carefully.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;Second one that is very important for this paper: The activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium (PDB 4j6u) was significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which reveals the antimicrobial activity of the molecule. Both compounds are biologically active, but their activity was moderate which did not support their efforts.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;Third one their binding study: 1. Why did the authors consider Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium N205A mutant pdb id 4j6u? As they did not report any enzyme specific inhibition related experiments. 2. Docking is a preliminary experiment. How did the author validate the docking protocol? The authors are suggested using some decoy ligands and calculating the enrichment value in order to justify the docking protocol followed by ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments. In addition, authors are suggested to report at list 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability report followed by either MM-GB or PB-SA based thermo data analysis. 3. The pdb id 4j6u does not contain any bound ligand. How did the author select the binding site? If a few sets of amino acids were considered to define the binding site, then on what basis they select them? 4. The authors did not report any Tyrosinase enzyme inhibition assay, they are requested to justify Tyrosinase inhibition as the probable mechanism of action for these sets of ligands by providing suitable literature references.

Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;We appreciate the recommendation and agree with the reviewer that the computational and experimental results of antimicrobial activity differ to some extent in this part of the study and required further investigation to understand why such activity differs to the ligands by other means in the future.

Fortunately, we have found outstanding results during the chemo-sensor study and hopefully, we could be able to show the excellent usage of the ligands as a chemo-sensor in near future. Also, we are planning to do a fluorescence imaging study of protein-ligands.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and the following are the answers in response to the question for the kind consideration of the reviewer-
 Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis, which is essential for pigmentation. Dysfunction of tyrosinase may cause skin cancer. It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-103]. That’s why, to investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds with in vitro data, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium was performed. Also, molecular docking with other proteins of B. Megaterium was conducted, but 46ju provided better binding affinity with the synthesized compounds. For this reason, we aim to study the structure of tyrosinase from the bacteria.
 Preliminary antimicrobial studies were carried out to validate the docking protocol. At present, we are doing the fluorescence activities of these ligands and L2 showed excellent fluorescent emission at λmax 520 nm. So, we hope that we will carry out ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments and 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability in the future for our next study since within this shortest time, we are unable to do these experiments.
 The active binding site of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp. The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation. We have included this in the manuscript as follows:
 4.9. Molecular Docking Study
 Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93-96]. To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed. It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-100].
 4.9.1. Binding affinity of L1 and L2
 The highest anti-bacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1. The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, which were calculated by AutoDock Vina. The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in the Fig. 6.
 In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1. Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively. Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl). L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig. 6). Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively. Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala44A, and ALA44B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which also supports the literature [101-103].
 
 Thus, computational results are in good agreement with in vitro antibacterial behaviour of our compounds for novel antibacterial drug design."

 Polytopic organic ligands with hydrazone moiety are in the forefront of new drug research among many others due to their unique and versatile functionality and ease of strategic ligand design. Quantum chemical calculations of these polyfunctional ligands can be carried out in silico to determine the thermodynamic parameters. In this report two new tritopic dihydrazide ligands, N'2, N'6-bis[(1E)-1-(thiophen-2-yl) ethylidene] pyridine-2, 6-dicarbohydrazide (L1) and N'2, N'6-bis[(1E)-1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl) ethylidene] pyridine-2, 6-dicarbohydrazide (L2) were successfully prepared by the condensation reaction of pyridine-2, 6-dicarboxylic hydrazide with 2-acetylthiophene and 2-acetylpyrrole. The FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR as well as mass spectra of both L1 and L2 were recorded and analyzed. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at DFT/B3LYP/cc-pvdz/6-311+ G (d, p) level of theory to study the molecular geometry, vibrational frequencies, and thermodynamic properties including changes of ∆H, ∆S, and ∆G for both the ligands. The optimized vibrational frequency and (1H and 13C) NMR obtained by B3LYP/cc-pvdz/6-311 + G (d, p) showed good agreement with experimental FT-IR and NMR data. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations were also conducted to find the HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO–LUMO gaps of the two synthesized compounds. To investigate the biological activities of the ligands, L1 and L2 were tested in vitro bioassays against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus strain. In addition, Molecular ‪docking was used to study the molecular behavior of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium. The outcomes revealed that both L1 and L2 can suppress microbial growth of bacteria and fungi with variable potency. The antibacterial activity results demonstrated the compound L2 to be potentially effective against Bacillus Megaterium with inhibition zones of 12 mm while molecular docking study showed the binding energies for L1 and L2 to be −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1 respectively with tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium.‪"

 2.1.3. Antimicrobial activity assay
 
 In vitro antimicrobial activity of synthesized ligands was evaluated by agar disc diffusion method [40]. Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used as a control medium for testing against bacteria and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used for fungal strain. After preparation, the MHA and PDA medias were incubated for 24 h and contaminations were checked. After incubation, the test organism was inoculated using sterile cotton bar on media. The sample discs were put gently on pre-inoculated agar plates and aerobically incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for antibacterial and for 48 h at 26 °C for antifungal assay. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as control. Each disc was loaded with 25 µL of sample solution in DMSO containing 300 µg of synthesized compounds. 10 µL of ceftriaxone and amphotericin-B solutions containing 50 µg each in DMSO were loaded per disc for antibacterial and antifungal assays as positive control, respectively. The diameter of the inhibition zones in mm circling the disc were measured. Two gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (cars-2) and Bacillus Megaterium (BTCC-18), two gram-negative Escherichia coli (carsgn-2) and Salmonella Typhi (K-323130) bacteria, and two fungal strains Trichoderma harzianum (carsm-2) and Aspergillus niger (carsm-3) were used in this study."

 3.2. Protein-ligand Docking
 3.2.1. Ligand and Protein preparation:
 The structures of L1 and L2 have been fully optimized by using Gaussian 09 software at B3LYP/6-311G+ (d, p) level. The 3D crystal structure of tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u; resolution: 2.5Å, Chain A, B) was obtained in pdb format from online RCSB protein data bank (PDB) database. The structure was verified, and an energy minimization was performed with the Swiss-Pdb Viewer software packages (version 4.1.0) [44], since the crystal structure contains a variety of issues related to improper bond order, side chains geometry, and missing hydrogen atoms. Prior to docking, all the heteroatoms and water molecules were removed from the crystal structure using PyMol (version 1.3) software packages [45]. The active binding pocket of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp—having the highest pocket area and volume are 95.432 Å2 and 137.877 Å3, respectively [46]. The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation. Both the structures of the proteins and ligands were saved in .pdbqt format by AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2, May 11, 2011) for docking analysis [47].
 3.2.2. Molecular docking Analysis:
 The docking calculations were performed using default parameters and 8 docked conformations were generated for both compounds. The energy calculations were done by genetic algorithms. Nonpolar hydrogen atoms, Gasteiger partial charges, rotatable bonds, and grid box with dimensions 66.57 × 58.25 × 84.98 Å3 created on the tyrosinase with the aid of Auto Dock Tools 1.1.2 and spacing of 0.3750 Å. The docked conformation of the respective protein conformer with lowest binding free energy and root mean-square deviation value (RMSD) 0.0 Å was analyzed using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 1.7.4) and Accelrys Discovery Studio 4.1 [49].

The structure was verified, and an energy minimization was performed with the Swiss-Pdb Viewer software packages (version 4.1.0) [44], since the crystal structure contains a variety of issues related to improper bond order, side chains geometry, and missing hydrogen atoms. Prior to docking, all the heteroatoms and water molecules were removed from the crystal structure using PyMol (version 1.3) software packages [45]. The active binding pocket of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp—having the highest pocket area and volume are 95.432 Å2 and 137.877 Å3, respectively [46]. The binding site residues predicted by CastP for tyrosinase were used for grid generation. Both the structures of the proteins and ligands were saved in .pdbqt format by AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2, May 11, 2011) for docking analysis [47].
 3.2.2. Molecular docking Analysis:
 The docking calculations were performed using default parameters and 8 docked conformations were generated for both compounds. The energy calculations were done by genetic algorithms. Nonpolar hydrogen atoms, Gasteiger partial charges, rotatable bonds, and grid box with dimensions 66.57 × 58.25 × 84.98 Å3 created on the tyrosinase with the aid of Auto Dock Tools 1.1.2 and spacing of 0.3750 Å. The docked conformation of the respective protein conformer with lowest binding free energy and root mean-square deviation value (RMSD) 0.0 Å was analyzed using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 1.7.4) and Accelrys Discovery Studio 4.1 [49]."

 2.1.3. Antimicrobial activity assay
 In vitro antimicrobial activity of synthesized ligands was evaluated by agar disc diffusion method [40]. Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used as a control medium for testing against bacteria and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used for fungal strain. After preparation, the MHA and PDA medias were incubated for 24 h and contaminations were checked. After incubation, the test organism was inoculated using sterile cotton bar on media. The sample discs were put gently on pre-inoculated agar plates and aerobically incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for antibacterial and for 48 h at 26 °C for antifungal assay. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as control. Each disc was loaded with 25 μL of sample solution in DMSO containing 300 μg of synthesized compounds. 10 μL of ceftriaxone and amphotericin-B solutions containing 50 μg each in DMSO were loaded per disc for antibacterial and antifungal assays as positive control, respectively. The diameter of the inhibition zones in mm circling the disc were measured. Two gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (cars-2) and Bacillus Megaterium (BTCC-18), two gram-negative Escherichia coli (carsgn-2) and Salmonella Typhi (K-323130) bacteria, and two fungal strains Trichoderma harzianum (carsm-2) and Aspergillus niger (carsm-3) were used in this study.

 4.9. Molecular Docking Study
 Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93 96]. To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed. It is well known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97 100]."

 Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized to present a wide range of biological activities in recent years. In this present study we have synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also done. The computed FT-IR analysis as well as the 1H and 13C NMR using B3LYP/CC-PVDZ/6-311+G(d, p) method agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results. We further evaluated the thermodynamic parameters ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG of the ligands. The geometry optimization revealed the planarity of L1 and L2 molecules. Further, it was seen from the HOMO-LUMO energy values that the chemical potentials were negative and the frontier orbital gap of the molecule under investigation was small, and hence, both compounds are reactive and polarizable. To further showcase the biological activity of the ligands against organic pathogens, the antimicrobial assay was performed and revealed significant inhibition of L2 against Bacillus Megaterium gram positive bacteria, and L1 against Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger although in lesser extent. The moderate activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium is substantiated by molecular docking study against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium and was found significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which might suggest the antimicrobial activity of the molecule. Overall, L1 and L2 compounds have spurred significant interest for us from the synthetic, computational and biological point of view. We anticipate continued research regarding these classes of exciting organic ligands."
Reviewer_3;Author;3;1;0;"The molecular study needs a control molecule to compare the results of L1 and L2. how would we know that −7.7 and −8.8 are good scores or not. Either perform a quick analysis for a molecule known for its tyrosinase inhibition or compare with other studies control that used the same methods in your paper.For exemple in this study ""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.078"" they used Arbutin to compare the results of their studied molecule."

 4.9. Molecular Docking Study
 Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding of ligand-receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [92-95]. To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analyses of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed. It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [96-99]. The docking results were also compared with well-testified inhibitor arbutin [97].
 4.9.1. Binding affinity of L1 and L2
 The highest antibacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1. The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were −7.7 and −8.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, whereas for arbutin-4j6u the value was -9.1 kcal mol-1 which were calculated by AutoDock Vina. The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in Fig. 6.
 It was observed that arbutin formed six conventional hydrogen bonds with 4j6u (Supplementary Fig. S11) by the following residues: ALA40A (one O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), Glu141A (four O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), and LYS47B (one O-H----O-C hydro-gen bond). Also several hydrophobic interactions were found with ILE139A, ILE39A, and ALA40A. In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 Å) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1. Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively. Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl). L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH….O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 Å), GLY143B (3.04 Å), Tyr267A (3.07 Å) and PRO219B (2.91 Å) (Fig. 6). Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 Å. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 Å), LYS47A (4.35 Å), ALA44B (3.95 Å), LYS47B (4.98 Å), PRO52A (5.04 Å), ALA40B (4.67 Å) and ILE139B (4.24 Å), respectively. Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala40A, Ala44A, ALA44B and Lys47B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which are in close vicinity to the control arbutin and supports the literature [100-102]."
