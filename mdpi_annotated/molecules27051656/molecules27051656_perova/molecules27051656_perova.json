      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "Second one that is very important for this paper: The activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium (PDB 4j6u) was significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which reveals the antimicrobial activity of the molecule. Both compounds are biologically active, but their activity was moderate which did not support their efforts.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Third one their binding study: 1. Why did the authors consider Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium N205A mutant pdb id 4j6u? As they did not report any enzyme specific inhibition related experiments. 2. Docking is a preliminary experiment. How did the author validate the docking protocol? The authors are suggested using some decoy ligands and calculating the enrichment value in order to justify the docking protocol followed by ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments. In addition, authors are suggested to report at list 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability report followed by either MM-GB or PB-SA based thermo data analysis. 3. The pdb id 4j6u does not contain any bound ligand. How did the author select the binding site? If a few sets of amino acids were considered to define the binding site, then on what basis they select them? 4. The authors did not report any Tyrosinase enzyme inhibition assay, they are requested to justify Tyrosinase inhibition as the probable mechanism of action for these sets of ligands by providing suitable literature references."

Fortunately, we have found outstanding results during the chemo-sensor study and hopefully, we could be able to show the excellent usage of the ligands as a chemo-sensor in near future. Also, we are planning to do a fluorescence imaging study of protein-ligands.",
      "Author.2.3": "We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and the following are the answers in response to the question for the kind consideration of the reviewer-\r\n Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis, which is essential for pigmentation. Dysfunction of tyrosinase may cause skin cancer. It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-103]. That\u2019s why, to investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds with in vitro data, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium was performed. Also, molecular docking with other proteins of B. Megaterium was conducted, but 46ju provided better binding affinity with the synthesized compounds. For this reason, we aim to study the structure of tyrosinase from the bacteria.\r\n Preliminary antimicrobial studies were carried out to validate the docking protocol. At present, we are doing the fluorescence activities of these ligands and L2 showed excellent fluorescent emission at \u03bbmax 520 nm. So, we hope that we will carry out ALA scan (Alanine scanning) based MD experiments and 100ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation guided protein-ligand stability in the future for our next study since within this shortest time, we are unable to do these experiments.\r\n The active binding site of tyrosinase was predicted by CASTp. The binding site residues predicted by CASTp for tyrosinase were used for grid generation. We have included this in the manuscript as follows:\r\n 4.9. Molecular Docking Study\r\n Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding for ligand receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [93-96]. To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analysis of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed. It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [97-100].\r\n 4.9.1. Binding affinity of L1 and L2\r\n The highest anti-bacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1. The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were \u22127.7 and \u22128.8 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, which were calculated by AutoDock Vina. The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in the Fig. 6.\r\n In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 \u00c5) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1. Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively. Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl). L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH\u2026.O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 \u00c5), GLY143B (3.04 \u00c5), Tyr267A (3.07 \u00c5) and PRO219B (2.91 \u00c5) (Fig. 6). Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 \u00c5. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 \u00c5), LYS47A (4.35 \u00c5), ALA44B (3.95 \u00c5), LYS47B (4.98 \u00c5), PRO52A (5.04 \u00c5), ALA40B (4.67 \u00c5) and ILE139B (4.24 \u00c5), respectively. Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala44A, and ALA44B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which also supports the literature [101-103].\r\n \r\n Thus, computational results are in good agreement with in vitro antibacterial behaviour of our compounds for novel antibacterial drug design.",

Antimicrobial activity assay\r\n In vitro antimicrobial activity of synthesized ligands was evaluated by agar disc diffusion method [40]. Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used as a control medium for testing against bacteria and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media (HIMEDIA, India) was used for fungal strain. After preparation, the MHA and PDA medias were incubated for 24 h and contaminations were checked. After incubation, the test organism was inoculated using sterile cotton bar on media. The sample discs were put gently on pre-inoculated agar plates and aerobically incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C for antibacterial and for 48 h at 26 \u00b0C for antifungal assay.

      "Author.2.19": "We appreciate the recommendation and changed the conclusion as follows,\r\n 9\r\n Pyrrole and thiophene as organic molecules and their metal cluster derivatives have been recognized to present a wide range of biological activities in recent years. In this present study we have synthesized two tritopic dihydrazide based ligands bearing Pyrrole and Thiophene as end groupings and characterized successfully by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. Based on the DFT the calculations, a complete structural detail, vibrational, electrostatic potential, Mulliken population, HOMO-LUMO and thermodynamic analysis were also done. The computed FT-IR analysis as well as the 1H and 13C NMR using B3LYP/CC-PVDZ/6-311+G(d, p) method agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results. We further evaluated the thermodynamic parameters \u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394G of the ligands. The geometry optimization revealed the planarity of L1 and L2 molecules. Further, it was seen from the HOMO-LUMO energy values that the chemical potentials were negative and the frontier orbital gap of the molecule under investigation was small, and hence, both compounds are reactive and polarizable. To further showcase the biological activity of the ligands against organic pathogens, the antimicrobial assay was performed and revealed significant inhibition of L2 against Bacillus Megaterium gram positive bacteria, and L1 against Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger although in lesser extent. The moderate activity of L2 molecule against Bacillus Megaterium is substantiated by molecular docking study against tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium and was found significant with a binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol and three hydrogen bond interactions, which might suggest the antimicrobial activity of the molecule. Overall, L1 and L2 compounds have spurred significant interest for us from the synthetic, computational and biological point of view. We anticipate continued research regarding these classes of exciting organic ligands.",
      "Author.4.1": "We appreciate the recommendation and rewrote the Molecular Docking study as follows as suggested by the reviewer,\r\n 4.9. Molecular Docking Study\r\n Molecular docking is a powerful tool to investigate and provide a proper understanding of ligand-receptor interactions in order to facilitate the design of potential drugs [92-95]. To investigate and compare the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds, docking analyses of L1 and L2 against tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium were performed. It is well-known that tyrosinase of Bacillus Megaterium bacteria is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials or antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of hyperpigmentation because of its similarity (33.5%) to the human enzyme [96-99]. The docking results were also compared with well-testified inhibitor arbutin [97].\r\n 4.9.1. Binding affinity of L1 and L2\r\n The highest antibacterial activity (zone of inhibition 12 mm) of compound L2 was detected with tyrosinase from Bacillus Megaterium (PDB ID: 4j6u) bacteria compared to L1. The binding energies for L1 and L2 with Bacillus Megaterium were \u22127.7 and \u22128.8 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, whereas for arbutin-4j6u the value was -9.1 kcal mol-1 which were calculated by AutoDock Vina. The interactions of the 4j6u with compounds L1 and L2 are shown in Fig. 6.\r\n It was observed that arbutin formed six conventional hydrogen bonds with 4j6u (Supplementary Fig. S11) by the following residues: ALA40A (one O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), Glu141A (four O-H----O-C hydrogen bond), and LYS47B (one O-H----O-C hydro-gen bond). Also several hydrophobic interactions were found with ILE139A, ILE39A, and ALA40A. In L1-4j6u, one conventional hydrogen bond (3.04 \u00c5) of O-H----O-C observed between O-H of Tyr267A and O-C group of compounds L1. Pi-cation, pi-sulfur and amide-pi bonds were also noticed with LYS47A, PHE48A, ILE39A, ALA40A, GLY43B and ALA44B, respectively. Moreover, ALA44A, LYS47A, ALA44B, LYS47B, PRO52A, ALA40B and ILE139B were actively involved in the non-covalent interaction (hydrophobic pi-alkyl). L2-4j6u complex was stabilized by four NH\u2026.O hydrogen bonds and they were LYS47A (2.25 \u00c5), GLY143B (3.04 \u00c5), Tyr267A (3.07 \u00c5) and PRO219B (2.91 \u00c5) (Fig. 6). Like L1, L2 formed pi-cation and amide-pi bonds with LYS47A, ILE39A, GLY43B, where the distances were 3.73, 4.34, 3.54 \u00c5. L2 also formed seven pi-alkyl bonds with ALA44A (5.19 \u00c5), LYS47A (4.35 \u00c5), ALA44B (3.95 \u00c5), LYS47B (4.98 \u00c5), PRO52A (5.04 \u00c5), ALA40B (4.67 \u00c5) and ILE139B (4.24 \u00c5), respectively. Results of docking studies revealed that L1 and L2 formed bonds to the active site of tyrosinase and showed strong interactions with Tyr267A, Ala40A, Ala44A, ALA44B and Lys47B of tyrosinase enzyme (PDB ID: 4j6u), which are in close vicinity to the control arbutin and supports the literature [100-102].",
