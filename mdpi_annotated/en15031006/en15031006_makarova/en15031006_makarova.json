      "Author.2.1": "According to your suggestion, in the revised version of the manuscript, the unnecessary use of subjective pronoun is removed and overall writing of the paper is improved. ",
      "Author.2.2": "Thank you for your comment. Due to the lack of real time datasets, we have used the publically available datasets for the verification of the proposed system.",
      "Author.2.3": "According to your suggestion, the novelty of the proposed work has been made more clear and understandable for readers in the introduction section as follows: \r\nIn this work, a DSM algorithm is proposed by using renewable resources PV and wind turbines for \r\nthose houses that are located far away from the main city. Battery storage bank is included in the \r\nsystem to provide the baseload power in the time when renewable sources are not suffice to meet \r\nthe baseload power demand. Diesel generators equal to the rating of base load is kept as backup to \r\navoid total black out in worse conditions. Our objective is to schedule and shift the controllable \r\nappliances by estimating hourly power generation and considering consumer demand as a variable \r\nfunction. The appliances are prioritized based on their need and demand to achieve optimum energy \r\nutilization.\r\nThe main contribution of this paper include:\r\n\uf0b7 A demand side management algorithm is proposed to fulfil the energy gap between \r\ngeneration and consumer\u2019s demand for standalone renewable energy system.\r\n\uf0b7 K-mean clustering is used to make clusters of the data based on two factors: probability \r\nof turning ON a specific appliance at time t and priority number given by consumer to \r\nthat specific appliance. \r\n\uf0b7 Linear integer programming is used to schedule the appliances based on the available \r\npower and state of charge of the battery system.",
      "Author.2.4": "According to your suggestion, we have modified the literature review and included some latest references i.e., [22][29][30][32]. In addition, we organized the literature review in more comprehensive \r\nway.",
      "Author.2.5": "According to your suggestion, we have improved the Figures as can be seen in the revised version of the manuscript.",
      "Author.2.6": "Thank you for your comment. As Sizing of the grid system is not the main goal of the article, \r\nbut as per your suggestion, it is briefly discuss in the subsections of Mathematical modelling of the Energy \r\nsources. Both solar and wind systems are designed for output power equal to the consumer\u2019s load whose \r\nannual load curve peak is maximum out of all the consumer\u2019s in the community. Battery storage systems \r\nhave the capability to supply uninterrupted power equal to the base load of the system up to 6 hours. And \r\ndiesel generator equal to the rating of system\u2019s base load is kept as a backup to avoid total black out situation. \r\nThe designed system is not the time-varying tariff, therefore the overall system is designed to treat each \r\nconsumer of the community equally. In time-varying tariff based system, the sizing of the system is the \r\nmain objective as to accommodate the wealthy consumers of the community. ",
      "Author.2.7": "According to your suggestion the consumer comfortability is discussed from line 144-160. \r\nIn this work, a DSM algorithm is proposed by using renewable resources PV and wind turbines for those \r\nhouses that are located far away from the main city.
