      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The plasma conditions are not described sufficiently. It is only stated that the argon-nitrogen mixture \u2018mainly emits high amounts of radiation in the wavelength region from 100 nm to 400 nm\u2019 without specifying what high fluences at the sample site are. The term amount is not applicable here. With the knowledge of the spectral irradiance in the UV range from 100 to 400 nm the authors could have made a calculation to estimate the inactivation of D. radiodurans by the UV component of the plasma.",

For the argon-oxygen gas mixture it is stated that \u2018high amounts of reactive oxygen species are formed in the plasma\u2019 again without any qualitative and quantitative description. Estimations of the average free length of path for the inactivating plasma components might have been helpful for experiment planning.",

      "Author.2.1": "The authors would like to thank for this helpful comment. We changed the subsection as described below. With stating that argon-nitrogen mixtures mainly emit high amounts of radiation, the authors want to emphasize, that the sterilization efficiency is based on radiation rather than interaction of radicals with the sample. In low-pressure argon-nitrogen plasmas, the only significant possible radical is atomic nitrogen. As atomic nitrogen is not known for high etching efficiency towards organic materials, the main reason for inactivation of D. radiodurans is based on radiation effects. Furthermore, Argon-Nitrogen plasmas emit high amounts of radiation compared to Argon-Oxygen plasmas, as shown for example in [5]. The data in [5] is not comparable in absolute values, as the system was changed afterwards. Absolutely calibrated spectra were measured and have been submitted in another publication.\r\n The authors think that estimating the inactivation efficiency towards D. radiodurans based on the UV dose cannot be performed on a reliable bases due to the following reasons: First, the inactivation efficiency towards spores is not only depending on the overall dose of the emitted radiation, but especially on the dose per wavelength. This has been demonstrated by Munakata et al. for B. subtilis spores (Munakata et al., Photochemistry and Photobiology, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1991, 54, 761-768). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, there is no publication measuring the wavelength depending inactivation efficiency of B. radiodurans in the VUV. Second, the samples are mixed with Mars Analog Soil and most of the samples are covered with it. This leads to a very inhomogeneous exposure of the samples which can only be estimated arbitrarily.\r\n To address the reviewer\u2019s comments, subsection 2.3 has been modified as follows:\r\n An argon-nitrogen mixture (100:5 sccm) was used with continuous power of 500 W, as it emits significantly higher amounts of radiation in the bactericidal wavelength region from 100 nm to 400 nm compared to an argon-oxygen mixture (100:5 sccm) [5]. The absolute values presented in [5] are not applicable to the results shown here, due to modification of the plasma system concerning the power coupling. Nevertheless, the significantly higher emission of the argon-nitrogen mixture is shown. Absolute values of the radiation dose in the range from 100 nm to 400 nm of the system configuration used in this study were measured and submitted [6]. A possible radical that can interact with the samples is atomic nitrogen. As atomic nitrogen is not known for etching of organic materials, we assume that inactivation in the argon-nitrogen mixture is based on radiation effects.\r\n [6] Raguse, M.; Fiebrandt, M.; Denis, B.; Stapelmann, K.; Eichenberger, P.; Driks, A.; Eaton, P.; Awakowicz, P.; Moeller, R.

Submitted to Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics.",
      "Author.2.2": "The authors thank the referee for this comment that demonstrates that the authors need to clarify. However, to the authors it is not clear which potentially inactivating components of the plasma are not specified, as radicals and radiation are mentioned and the temperature is kept below 80\u00b0C to prevent inactivation effects due to heating. As the samples are placed in an ICP discharge, ions towards the samples are only accelerated by several tenth of eV. Thus, sputtering of the sample due to ion bombardment can be neglected.\r\n Low-pressure plasmas dissociate molecular gases up to several percent. Thus, the authors wanted to emphasize, that the atomic oxygen density and therewith the atomic oxygen flux to the samples is in the order of a few percent of the overall gas flux. Quantitative and even qualitative analysis of atomic oxygen densities by optical emission spectroscopy is not an easy task as several parameters like gas temperature, electron density and electron temperature are necessary. This is even more challenging in pulsed mode, as the plasma does not achieve a steady state due to switching it on and off to prevent intensive heating of the plasma. Determination of the gas densities and plasma parameters is currently addressed in extensive analysis of plasmas with different gas compositions but not finished and published yet. Nevertheless, the authors\u2019 state, that a relevant amount of atomic oxygen species is produced in the low pressure argon-oxygen plasma as the minimum energy for dissociation of molecular oxygen is around 5 eV. The ionization energy for argon is 16 eV and 13 eV for molecular oxygen. Thus, sufficient electrons with enough energy to dissociate molecular oxygen will be present in the plasma for dissociation up to a few percent.\r\n In the authors\u2019 view, estimating the mean free path of the atomic oxygen in the plasma is not necessary, as recombination of radicals in low pressure plasmas in the regime of a few Pascal takes place at the surfaces. Thus, any radical formed will be lost at the walls and not on its way to a surface. Estimating the mean free path of the radical in the Mars Analog Soil can only be performed on an arbitrary basis as the sticking and recombination coefficients of atomic oxygen are not known for the Mars Analog Soil. Thus, any calculation of the mean free path of the radical is based on estimated data and could only be verified by experiments.\r\n To address the reviewer\u2019s comments, subsection 2.3 has been modified as follows:\r\n Only JSC Mars-1A analog soil was used in the second trial. In this case, an argon-oxygen mixture (100:5 sccm) was used as it produces reactive oxygen species due to dissociation of molecular oxygen in the plasma. Since radiation-based sterilization is faster than sterilization due to oxidation, the treatment time was increased. As this leads to heating of the sample above 80 \u00b0C in the continuous plasma, we used a pulsed mode, switching the plasma on and off at a frequency of 1 kHz and a duty cycle of 10 %. To account for this fact, the treatment time was increased to 45 min, yielding a plasma exposure time of 4.5 min. Furthermore, the power was increased to 1500 W, yielding a mean power of 150 W, as it is only applied 10 % of the time. The plasma conditions are not matched to each other as the main objective was to observe to what degree the cells of D. radiodurans were affected by radiation or reactive species and not which component is more efficient. As the samples are placed in an ICP discharge, ions towards the samples are only accelerated by several tenth of eV. Thus, sputtering of the sample due to ion bombardment can be neglected as possible inactivation mechanism.",
      "Author.2.3": "The grain size distributions of the three Mars regolith simulants have been added to the text in form of two additional tables (table 2: P-MRS and S-MRS; and table 3: JSC Mars-1A), as well as a new citation for the grain size distribution of JSC Mars-1A [8].\r\n \r\n To assess the shading effect of the regolith is difficult. As described we used a very thin layer of regolith particles, but did not measure them according to their shading effect but according to the weight, which was the same for all types of regolith. This experiment was meant as a test of the sterilization method adjusted to our purposes, as described in the introduction section. Therefore, we did not plan it according to the maximal theoretically achievable sterilization effect, but to design a life detection mission to Mars.\r\n [8] Wan, L., Wendner, R., & Cusatis, G.

      "Author.2.4": "The title has been changed.",
      "Author.2.5": "In the introduction we already described the problem of the destructiveness of heat sterilization like autoclaving on the organic contents of a soil, which was our motivation to test an alternative method such as low temperature plasma sterilization. D. radiodurans was used as test organism because of its resistance towards UV radiation, which is a part of the sterilizing effect of plasma sterilization. The appropriate passages in the introduction section have been edited.",
      "Author.2.6": "Since we did not intend to test the influences of the Martian Analog soils on D. radiodurans, but the sterilizing effect of the low temperature plasma treatment on cells intermixed with soil, we did not make a control to determine the effects of the Mars analog soils. The starting values of cell numbers were estimated on samples prepared the same way as the samples for the plasma sterilization (intermixed with soils and desiccated as described in the method section). They were incubated on TYG agar plates like the plasma samples after the treatment. This explanation was missing in the text and has now been added to the appropriate passages in the method section (Chapter 2.2.) for a better understanding.",

      "Author.2.13": "The differences might be caused due to the finer grain size of the other regolith used - particularly P-MRS, which possibly increased the shielding effect. This has been added to the discussion section.",
