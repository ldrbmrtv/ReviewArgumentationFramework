      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "In Table II, Tonset DCS is a units of temperature, it should be used comma instead of decimal point.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "At line 167, \u201cdonateis\u201d is typically used to represent donate money, we proposed change to be\r\n \u201cprovide\u201d, in additional, this sentence is not fluent at grammar.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.9": "Integration of all the above problems, this post Journal does not provide future applications of phytic\r\n acid in cosmetics and its title is mentioned in herbal lotion but the experiment did not use any herb\r\n emulsion formulation. For the antioxidant capacity of phytic acid only do the experiment of DPPH that\r\n has not more in-depth study. Lot of grammatical errors is found in sentences. So we suggested to big\r\n modifications, then returned for review.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "From the experimental results that phytic acid will decrease the thermal stability of the emulsion, but\r\n at line 220 mention that phytic acid has the effect of lipid peroxidation and therefore can be added as an\r\n anti-oxidant in the emulsion. So we recommend authors to describe these two points much clearer."
