      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "We recommend \u201cgalenic\u201d can be changed to herbaceous, because galenic is not usually to see for\n non-professional fields or general cosmetics reader.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.9": "Integration of all the above problems, this post Journal does not provide future applications of phytic\n acid in cosmetics and its title is mentioned in herbal lotion but the experiment did not use any herb\n emulsion formulation. For the antioxidant capacity of phytic acid only do the experiment of DPPH that\n has not more in-depth study. Lot of grammatical errors is found in sentences. So we suggested to big\n modifications, then returned for review.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "From the experimental results that phytic acid will decrease the thermal stability of the emulsion, but\n at line 220 mention that phytic acid has the effect of lipid peroxidation and therefore can be added as an\n anti-oxidant in the emulsion. So we recommend authors to describe these two points much clearer."

      "Author.2.14": "We mentioned in the text more information about incorporation of phytic acid into emulsion on\n Thermal Analysis results, DPPH results and conclusion.",
      "Author.2.15": "Regarding with this queries we improved the discussion in the results on page 7. But we need to\n study more about.",
      "Author.4.1": "We described these two points more clearly. The thermal analysis technique applies high\n temperatures in the samples due to this thermal stability of the emulsion associated with phytic\n acid decreased.",
