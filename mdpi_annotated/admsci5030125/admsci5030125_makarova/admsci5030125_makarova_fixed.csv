Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;My principle concern is with the logical construction of the paper. Given the number and apparent scope of adaptations of the CIRA method, I am not sure that I am more familiar with CIRA or its advantages having read the paper than I was previously.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;While the authors describe the process as a case study, the procedure they use is a table top exercise. Rather than developing a case through research, interviews, or observation, they presented a stylized scenario to academic peers for discussion.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;Given the authors stated goal of promoting the CIRA technique and approach to demonstrating its uses, I would recommend re-formatting the paper as a pedagogical tool. Rather than claiming to validate the method, focus on a detailed step by step examination of its implementation using a known outcome.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;The paper needs smoother transitions between topics on pages 2-7. The authors should add one or two lines smoothing the flow for the reader, rather than relying on subject headings. Traditionally, limitations are listed towards the end of the paper.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;The paper is on the one hand quite verbose, but with respect to the peer review incomplete.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;The line of reasoning in the paper is not easy to follow.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;The paper can become stronger if it limits itself to the Peer Review Ring Incident and will look at the various aspects of that scenario including risk reducing measures
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;Much of what is analyzed and concluded is rather obvious.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;5;0;What are the conclusions about the root cause? Or are there multiple root causes? And what definition of root cause is used?
Reviewer_3;Author;1;1;0;Regarding section 2, literature review should usually be structured with explicitly stating what types of methodologies have already been developed/are existing in the context of what you studied or conducted your research on.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;2;0;If so, there is not enough explanation about the CIRA and the person(s) who developed this method. 
Reviewer_3;Author;1;3;0;Also there is not enough clarification and elaboration on the differences of your  work on CIRA and your customizations comparing to the original methodology.
