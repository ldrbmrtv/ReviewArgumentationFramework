Reviewer 1;Author;1;1;0;"I would
 like to see a comparison with at least one regular alignment/treeing method, based on the same genomes
 the authors used, and not just a visual topological comparison with other published trees."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;2;0;"As far as I can see, statistical support on the branches is missing, so I have no way of assessing if this
 branching order is valid. Bootstrapping or jackknifing are by no means the final word on the significance
 of branches, however an explanation as to how the user should assess the significance of braches would
 be good, i.e., branch length."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;3;0;"The fact that Thermofilum is placed outside Crenarchaeota in Figures 3 and 4 is a little disturbing. I
 haven’t come across such a placement in other phylogenetic analyses of Archaea, for example in
 Brochier-Armanet et al 2008 Nat Rev Microb, or Rinke et al. 2013 Nature. I believe this needs to better
 explained in the manuscript, rather than just saying “this fact is noted”."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;4;0;"I am also not very convinced with the placement of Nanoarchaeota. It seems like this phylum is
 moving around with the addition of new sequence data (for example in Rinke et al. Figure 2 tree, they
 are on an entirely different branch than Euryarchaeota). Though the authors also rightfully point out that
 the reduced genome size may have something to do with this placement."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;5;0;"The placement of Halobacteria (due to interfering Nanoarchaeota, I presume) is also a little
 disturbing. I would recommend that the authors provide a discussion of this. Especially with regards to
 other archaeal trees. For instance, in the tree of Armanet et al 2011 that the authors also refer to, the
 placement of Halobacteria with respect to Nanoarchaeota is very different."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;6;0;"In summary, I find the piece interesting, but parts of the discussion are rather weak, therefore I am
 suggesting a major revision. Another reason for major revision is the style that the manuscript is written.
 I am not a native speaker, but given that I had to read sentences several times, I suspect the manuscript
 can benefit from an English language check."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;1;0;"I would really appreciate a “Methods” part where the CVTree is explained shortly, and the
 tree-viewer is explained with more detail. The absence of branch lengths and bootstraps should be
 discussed here. Other technical aspects of the paper (e.g., sequence dataset), parameters, criteria ... all
 could be well organized in this part."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;2;0;"Archaeal phylogeny has already been studied in detail, with 16S and other marker genes, and with
 genomic approaches too. Some of the undersigning authors had already published on this before,
 although with smaller input datasets. Therefore, the fact that 16S topology is quite stable and
 comparable with other approaches is already known."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;3;0;"Taxonomists have traditionally circumscribed the high taxa (specially orders and classes) with great
 subjectivity, i.e., without well accepted criteria. In terms of phylogenetic trees one premise has always
 been clear, a taxon must be monophyletic. This principle has been used in the present work to reconsider
 the status of some high taxa. However, authors do not explain objective criteria to properly interpret the
 rank of the clades, which impedes making a profound evaluation of the archaeal classification.
 Therefore, although authors have strong tools and dataset, they just achieved a small revision of the high
 taxa which is, indeed, quite biased by the underlying 16S guidelines."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;4;0;"I have noted some lack of scientific rigor according to: many wrong taxonomic names and typos,
 scarce figure legends, few comments about the missing branch lengths or bootstraps (!), redundancy in
 text and figures and fragments which are really difficult to understand. Authors should pay attention to
 language, explanations and text organization."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;5;0;"Authors shouldn't forget (particularly in conclusion) that the resolution power of 16S for high ranks
 (genus and above) is currently well accepted. And the number of non-redundant 16S entries available is
 much much larger than that of archaeal genomes. 16s data offer a much comprehensive view of the
 archaeal diversity, including deep branches."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;6;0;L34–40: for me was difficult to follow this reasoning. Please rephrase.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;7;0;"L40 “Since at present (…) are not covered (...)” is a weak reason for choosing high ranks. I
 recommend to shortly summarize why high ranks are so important, and why do you choose order as
 the lowest considered rank."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;8;0;"The figure legends require more rigorous explanation. Would be interesting to remember that the
 branch lengths are not taken into account, or were omitted."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;9;0;"In Line 80—authors write some explanations to understand the tree figures. I would suggest to put
 this text before the first tree figure."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;10;0;"Figure 1 is a bit redundant. A short comment about the inclusion of that particular sequence into the
 Thermoplasmatales can be added into the legend of Figure 2."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;11;0;"However, the reclassification of Methanomassiliicoccus into Thermoplasmataceae needs more
 explanation. To be objective, authors should address the following question, why in the same family and
 not in another new family?"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;12;0;"L106–107: maybe a bit inappropriate on that position. I would suggest to add a comment on the figure
 legend instead."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;13;0;"L109–118: Summarize and move to introduction. Those sentences are of general importance for the
 topic and not specific to part 3.2."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;14;0;"L119–123: if the K issue is relevant to understand the text then please add a proper explanation. If not,
 then keep it simple and avoid entering into the K issue (L122–123, L132, L135, L139, 183, and also
 remove this K = 6 from Figure 3.)"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;15;0;Add more explanations in legend of Figure3
Reviewer 2;Author;1;16;0;"L143: Sounds clearer if you avoid mixing class and phylum, for example: “The placement of
 phylum Korarchaeota, as a closest neighbor of family Thermofilaceae, violates the monophyly of
 phylum Crenarchaeota.”"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;17;0;"L146: No need to explain the 6+2 if it is properly explained in the figure legend.
 Figure 3 is redundant. I would recommend to avoid presenting different versions of the same tree; just
 the final tree is OK (use final/valid labels) and all important explanations in the text or legend. Perhaps
 the whole reasoning in Lines 142–180 is not so relevant for the current objective of comparing CVT,
 LTP, Bergeys? Or, perhaps, define this objective more clearly."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;18;0;"L156–166. If I understood right, there was good support for Candidatus Aciduliprofundum as part of
 a clade called DHEV2, which is a sister clade of Thermoplasmatales. However in the present work the
 authors intend here to reclassify Aciduliprofundum into family Thermococcaceae of Thermococcales.
 This needs further explanation. Since the new affiliation is quite in disagreement with previous
 observations, and this is not properly justified in the results/discussion, the final statement “this
 modification would hold as long as no new facts challenge it” seems unacceptable. In addition, why should
 Aciduliprofundum be regarded as member of Thermococcaceae and not as another distinct family?"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;19;0;"L163: If I’m right the current observation actually does not support the previous work done
 by Brochier-Armanet."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;20;0;"L167–173: The names are wrongly written (please check the original submission). Authors have to
 explain with more clarity, why is this clade of rank class. If that is the case, is it a single-order class? A
 single family order? etc."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;21;0;"L174–180: I don’t understand the reasoning along this paragraph. In addition
 “haolphiic_archaeon_DL31” is not well written, please be careful when copying names from
 other source. Also, a similar question about the objectiveness for detecting high taxa: why not to
 create new family?"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;22;0;Figure 4: the reclassifications must be clearly justified in the text
Reviewer 2;Author;1;23;0;L191: organisms can't be validly published, but their names
Reviewer 2;Author;1;24;0;"L221–222: Sure, but authors do not provide explanations about how do they know that a clade in a
 tree is a family, an order, a class, etc. There is a lack of criteria to reclassify the leaves."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;25;0;L224: I don’t understand “3063 identical nucleotide positions”. Why identical?
Reviewer 2;Author;1;26;0;L239–244: hard to read, please rephrase
Reviewer 2;Author;1;27;0;"I disagree that CVTree approach is independent of 16S, because authors are using the current
 accepted classification (which is mainly 16S-based) to validate the observed clades."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;28;0;"Why at higher ranks, genomic approaches are more effective? That needs more explanation. And
 authors should also consider the large benefits of 16S data availability, specially at high ranks (genus
 and above) where the 16S has good resolution."

Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;"Multi-alignment of concatenated protein (or DNA) segments is a genome-scale, but not
 whole-genome approach. Its applicability depends on the scope of the phylogenetic study. When dealing
 with not-too-distantly related species it may yield more or less useful result. However, in a study
 covering many phyla it is very difficult, if not impossible, to collect a common set of conserved proteins.
 Moreover, the concatenation method can never lead to very convincing conclusion, as give or take a few
 proteins may change the result. The phylogenomics people have noticed this problem, see, e.g.,
 O. Jeffroy, H. Brinkman, F. Delsuc, H. Philippe (2008) Phylogenomics: the beginning of
 incongruence? Trends in Genetics, 22(4): 225–231.
 An example from the Bacteria domain is the relationship of the closely related Shigella and Escherichia
 coli strains. Concatenation of different number of genes led to different way of mixing-up of the two
 groups, but CVTree gave unambiguous separation of the strains as different species in the same genus
 Escherichia, see:
 G.-H. Zuo, Z. Xu, B.L. Hao (2013) Shigella strains are not clones of Escherichia coli but
 sister species in the genus Escherichia. Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics, 11: 61–65.
 In order to carry out multi-alignment of concatenated sequences, a postdoc or well-trained PhD student
 equipped with the corresponding software is required. In contrast, with genome sequencing becoming a
 common practice in many labs it costs no additional work for a bench-microbiologist to get phylogenetic
 and taxonomic information by using a convenient and publically available tool such as the CVTree web
 serve. Well, we would be glad to see comparison of CVTree phylogeny with multi-alignment of
 concatenated proteins if anyone finds a way to do it for so many diverse phyla, but we do not consider it
 as a doable job."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;2;2;"These points were discussed in the “Material and Method” section added at the suggestion
 of Reviewer 2. The following was copied from the manuscript:
 “Traditionally a newly generated phylogenetic tree is subject to statistical re-sampling tests
 such as bootstrap and jackknife. CVTree does not use sequence alignment. Consequently, there
 is no way to recognize informative or non-informative sites. Instead we take all the protein
 products encoded in a genome as a sampling pool for carrying out bootstrap or jackknife tests
 (citing our 2004 paper). Although it was very time-consuming, CVTrees did have well passed
 these tests (citing our 2010 paper). However, successfully passing statistical re-sampling tests
 only tells about the stability and self-consistency of the tree with respect to small variations of
 the input data. It is by far not a proof of objective correctness of the tree. Direct comparison of
 all branchings in a tree with an independent taxonomy at all ranks would provide such a proof,
 The 16S rRNA phylogeny cannot be verified by the Bergey's taxonomy, as the latter follows the
 former. However, agreement of branchings in CVTree with the Bergey's taxonomy would
 provide much stronger support to the tree as compared to statistical tests. This is the strategy we
 adopt for the CVTree approach.”
 “There are two aspects of a phylogenetic tree: the branching order (topology) and the branch
 lengths. Branching order is related to classification and branch length to evolution time.
 Calibration of branch lengths is always associated with the assumption that mutation rate
 remains more or less a constant across all species represented in a tree, an assumption that
 cannot hold true in a large-scale phylogenetic study like the present one. Therefore, branching
 order in trees is of primary concern, whereas calibration of branch lengths makes less sense.
 Accordingly, all figures in this paper only show the branching scheme without indication of
 branch lengths and bootstrap values”."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;3;3;"Yes, this is an apparent discrepancy of CVTree from 16S (and 23S) analysis for the given
 set of 179 archaeal genomes. However, in an on-going study of ours (not published yet) using a much
 larger data set this violation no longer shows up; both Korarchaeota and Crenarchaeota restore their
 phylum status. Taking into account the fact that both Korarchaeota and Thermofilaceae are
 represented by single species for the time being, their placement certainly requires further study with
 broader sampling of genomes."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;4;4;"Highly degenerated genomes of many symbiont organisms tend to move around, in
 particular, to the baseline of a tree and thus distorts the overall structure of the tree. Therefore, it is
 better not to mix them with free-living organisms in a study. We rephrased the corresponding
 paragraph in the manuscript:
 “The nanosized archaean symbiont Nanoarchaeum equitans has a highly reduced genome
 (490,885 bp). It is the only described representative of a newly proposed phylum Nanoarchaeota
 and it cuts into the otherwise monophyletic phylum Euryarchaeota. We note that the monophyly
 of Euryarchaeota was also violated by Nanoarchaeum in some 16S rRNA trees, see, e.g., Figure
 4 in a 2009 microbial survey as well as (c) and (d) in our Figure 3. It has been known that tiny
 genomes of endosymbiont microbes often tend to move towards baseline of a tree and distort the
 overall picture. In fact, we have suggested skipping such tiny genomes when studying bacterial
 phylogeny, see, e.g., (citing our 2010 paper) and a note in the home page of the CVTree Web
 Server. In the present case we may at most say that Nanoarchaeota probably makes a separate
 phylum, but its cutting into Euryarchaeota might be a side effect due to the tiny size of the highly
 reduced genome”."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;5;5;"Yes, there was certain disturbing effect of the tiny and lonely Nanoarchaeum genome, yet
 the Halobacteria is a very specific clade, forming a tightly connected group and moving around as a
 whole, mainly due to the biased acidity of their constituent amino acids. We anticipate that the relative
 placement of Halobacteria with respect to other groups may stabilize when more genomes are used to
 construct a tree."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;6;6;"We have done a major revision of the manuscript. A new “Material and Method” section
 has been added. Such issues as statistical resampling tests (bootstrap and jackknife), calibration of
 branch length, the meaning and choice of the peptide length K, etc., were discussed in the new section.
 Figures 1 and 2 were combined to a new Figure 1; Figures 3 and 4 were combined to become a new
 Figure 2. Figure captions were made more detailed. The whole text was checked for language flaws
 and many places were rephrased."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1;"A “Material and Method” section has been added where the CVTree algorithm, the
 interactive tree-viewer, statistical resampling tests (bootstrap, jackknife), calibration of branch
 lengths, etc., were discussed in slightly more detail."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;2;2;"Yes, 16S rRNA phylogeny is quite stable and it almost defines the present taxonomy.
 We have given due credit for this. In general, CVTree does not challenge 16S rRNA analysis but
 complement it."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;3;3;"A robust phylogenetic tree comes with a fixed branching order of leaves. One looks at the
 leaf names and their taxonomic lineage and tries to map the latter to the branches. To this end we
 added the following paragraphs in the “Material and Method” section.
 “There are two aspects of a phylogenetic tree: the branching order (topology) and the branch
 lengths. Branching order is related to classification and branch length to evolution time.
 Calibration of branch lengths is always associated with the assumption that mutation rate
 remains more or less a constant across all species represented in a tree, an assumption that
 cannot hold true in a large-scale phylogenetic study like the present one. Therefore, branching
 order in trees is of primary concern, whereas calibration of branch lengths makes less sense.
 Accordingly, all figures in this paper only show the branching scheme without indication of
 branch lengths and bootstrap values.”
 “Branching order in a tree by itself does not bring about taxonomic ranks, e,g, class or order.
 The latter can be assigned only after comparison with a reference taxonomy which is not a rigid
 framework but a modifiable system. Though a dissimilarity measure figures in the CVTree
 algorithm, it is not realistic to delineate taxa by using this measure at least for the time being.
 Even if defined in the future, it must be lineage-dependent. For example, it cannot be expected
 that the same degree of dissimilarity may be used to delineate classes in all phyla. In addition,
 monophyly is a guiding principle in comparing branching order with taxonomy. Here monophyly
 must be understood in a pragmatic way restricted to the given set of input data and the reference
 taxonomy. If all genomes from a taxon appear exclusively in a tree branch, the branch is said to
 be monophyletic.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;4;4;"We have reorganized the manuscript mainly by adding a new “Material and Method”
 section where discussions on branch length, statistical resampling, meaning and choice of K, etc.,
 were given. The original Figure 1 was deleted with some related points explained in the text
 accompanying the original Figure 2. All figure captions have been rewritten for clarity."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;5;5;"A few more sentences were added in the “Conclusion” regarding the power and
 achievement of the 16S rRNA analysis."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;6;6,7;"We tried to rephrase the paragraph by changing, deleting, or adding a few words as follows:
 “In this paper we study Archaea phylogeny across many phyla. This is in contrast with
 phylogeny of species in a narrow range of taxa, e.g., that of vertebrates (a subphylum) or human
 versus close relatives (a few genera). Accordingly, the phylogeny should be compared with
 taxonomy at large, or, as Cavalier-Smith (citing cavalier-smith 2002) put it, with
 “megaclassificaton” of prokaryotes. Although in taxonomy the description of a newly discovered
 organism necessarily starts from the lower ranks, higher rank assignments are often incomplete
 or lacking. At present the ranks above class are not covered by the Bacteriological Code. The
 number of plausible microbial phyla may reach hundreds and archaeal ones are among the less
 studied. According to the 16S rRNA analysis, the major archaeal classes and their subordinate
 orders have been more or less delineated. Therefore, in order to carry out the aforementioned
 cross verification we make emphasis on higher ranks such as phyla, classes, and orders. A study
 using 179 Archaea genomes should provide a framework for further study of lower ranks.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;7;8;"Branching order in a tree is directly related to taxonomy, while branch lengths have more
 to do with evolution. For large-scale phylogenetic study across many phyla the former is more
 important than the calibration of branch lengths.
 The latter is based on the assumption that mutation rate is more or less constant. This assumption
 cannot hold when dealing with many phyla."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;8;9;This is done in the newly added “Material and Method” section.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;9;10;"The original Figure 1 was deleted and a few words added to the legend of the original
 Figure 2, now the new Figure 1."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;10;11;"Judging by the cluster labeled as Euryarchaeote{0+3} in Figure 2 Methanomassiliicoccus
 was not reclassified into Thermoplasmataceae but to an yet un-specified class."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;11;12;The sentence has been moved to the legend of Fig. 1 and slightly rephrased
Author;Reviewer 2;2;12;13;Done.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;13;14;"the K issue is discussed in the newly added “Material and Method” section; so scattered
 mentioning of K has been deleted from the rest of text."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;14;15;Done in the caption of Figure 2.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;15;16;"We have rewritten the paragraph as:
 “The new phylum Korarchaeota violates the monophyly of the phylum Crenarchaeota by
 drawing to itself the family Thermofilaceae. However, in an on-going study of ours (not
 published yet) using a much larger data set, this violation no longer shows up; both
 Korarchaeota and Crenarchaeota restore their phylum status. Taking into account the fact that
 both Korarchaeota and Thermofilaceae are represented by single species for the time being,
 their placement certainly requires further study with broader sampling of genomes.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;16;17;"From the original Figures 3 and 4 only one has been kept and the legend rewritten. In fact,
 the whole paragraph changed to:
 “The newly proposed phylum Thaumarchaeota appears to be non-monophyletic as an outlying
 strain Candidatus Caldiarchaeum subterranum was assigned to this phylum according to the
 NCBI taxonomy. The NCBI assignment might reflect its position in some phylogenetic tree based
 on concatenated proteins, e.g., Figure 2 in […]. However, in the original paper reporting the
 discovery of this strain […] and in recent 16S rRNA studies, e.g., […], Candidatus
 Caldiarchaeum subterranum was proposed to make a new phylum Aigarchaeota. CVTrees
 support the introduction of this new phylum. A lineage modification of Candidatus
 Caldiarchaeum subterranum from Thaumarchaeota to Aigarchaeota would lead to a
 monophyletic Thaumarchaeota{7}.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;17;18;"The problem of taxonomic placement of Aciduliprofundum is a good example to
 demonstrate how one extract information from CVTrees. In the Reysenbach et al. Nature 2006 paper it
 was taken as the first cultivated member of the DHEV2 (deep-sea hydrothermal euryarchaeate 2)
 clade based on a maximum-likelihood 16S rRNA tree. Unfortunately, all other 13 members of this
 clade were represented by 16S rRNA sequences only and no genome data are available so far. The
 NCBI taxonomy gave an incomplete lineage: Archaea; Euryrchaeota; unclassified Euryarchaeota;
 missing taxonomic assignment at the rank class and below.
 In order to make use of CVTree we must touch on the K-issue a little more. The alignment-free
 comparison of genomes in CVTree is implemented by counting the number of K-peptides in the protein
 products encoded in a genome followed by subtraction of a random background caused by neutral
 mutations. The peptide length K looks like a parameter, but it is actually not a parameter. Using a
 longer K emphasizes species-specificity, while a shorter K takes into account more common features
 with neighboring species. However, we never adjust K: a fixed K is used for all genomes to construct a
 tree, but one may construct a series of trees for K = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, … We have shown repeatedly that
 R9
 K = 5 and 6 lead to best results in the sense of agreement with taxonomy, so usually only a K = 6 tree
 is given in publications.
 Let us look at a subtree, i.e., part of a tree, containing the organisms of interest. If the branching
 order in all trees built for different Ks turns out to be same, it would be a strong support to the
 branching order. In most cases the branching order varies with K: K = 3 and 4 make sense, K = 5 and
 6 yield the best, K = 7 and 8 become slightly worse, etc. For too big a K, even if the closest strains
 remain grouped together the whole tree may tend to become a star-tree, i.e., every small clade stands
 in its own and their mutual placements become less meaningful. Therefore, inspection of trees for a
 range of K-values provides an additional dimension to evaluate the results.
 For Aciduprofumdum we have a stable pair
 (<C>Thermococci{18}, <G>Aciduprofumdum{2}) at K=3, 5, 6, 7.
 At K = 4 we have
 (<C>Thermococci{18}, (<G>Staphylothermus{2}, <G>Aciduprofundum{2}))
 In all these cases Thermoplasmata stands farther away from the above pair. However, at K = 8 and
 9, when the overall tree picture has been largely distorted, Aciduliprofundum does stand closer to
 Thermaplasmata. Putting together all the above results we tend to consider the pair
 (<C>Thermococci{18}, <G>Aciduliprofundum{2}) as reflecting a more probable relation. Confined
 to the available data for the time being one may assign <G>Aciduliprofundum to <C>Thermococci,
 e.g., to denote the pair as
 <C>Thermococci{20}=(<F>Thermococcaceae{18}, <G>Aciduliprofundum{2})
 leaving its family unclassified or assign it to a new family. Without further phenotypic and
 chemotaxonomic evidence it is better not to introduce new taxon names if the present naming scheme
 is capable to accommodate the leaves without conflict. This was why we wrote “this modification
 would hold as long as no new facts challenge it”. Anyway, taxonomy has always been a work in
 progress. One has to be prepared for modifications when new data appear. To make a long story
 short, we have rewritten the paragraph as:
 “The Candidatus genus Aciduliprofundum is considered a member of the DHEV2 (deap-sea
 hydrothermal vent euryarchaeotic 2) phylogenetic cluster. No taxonomic information was given
 in the original papers [55,56]. The NCBI Taxonomy did not provide definite lineage information
 for this taxon at the class, order, and family ranks. According to [55] the whole DHEV2 cluster
 was located close to Thermoplamatales in a maximum-likelihood analysis of 16S rRNA
 sequences. A similar placement was seen in [54] where a Bayesian tree of the archaeal domain
 based on concatenation of 57 ribosomal proteins put a lonely Aciduliprofundum next to
 Thermoplasmata. However, in CVTrees, constructed for all K-values from 3 to 9,
 Aciduliprofundum juxstaposes with the class Thermococci{18}. An observation in [56] that this
 organism shares a rare lipid structure with a few species from Thermococcales may hint on its
 possible association with the latter. If we temporarily presume a lineage
 <C>Thermococci<O>Unclassified<F>Unclassified<G>Aciduliprofundum…
 R10
 one might have a monophyletic class <C>Thermococci{20}. Since none of the 13 DHEV2
 members listed in [55] has a sequenced genome so far, CVTree cannot tell the placement of the
 DHEV2 cluster as a whole for the time being. It remains an open problem as whether DHEV2 is
 close to Thermoplasmata or to Thermococci, or a new class is needed to accommodate DHEV2.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;18;19;No, we did not mean it.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;19;20;"We should first explain how these inappropriate names appeared. We have insisted to use
 the directory name at the NCBI FTP site as genome name. However, in November 2013 NCBI
 announced that they would not release genomes of different strains of the same species as before. In a
 period thereafter NCBI sometimes put several genomes in a directory and we had to extract the data
 and to assign a name from the “Source” line of the GenBank file. This caused some confusion. For
 example, as of February 27, 2015, a directory name at NCBI remained
 “archaeon_Mx1201_uid196597” and we had to change it to:
 Candidatus_Methanomethylophilus_alvus_Mx1201_uid196597
 Now all “wrong names” as pointed out by the Reviewer no longer appear in figures. In the text we
 tried to refer to their names as complete as possible."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;20;21;"The genome name at NCBI FTP site is “halophilic_archaeon_DL31_uid72619”. The uid
 number was dropped when mentioned in the text. We put it back and capitalized the first letter to
 “Halophilic”, still an illegal genus name."

Author;Reviewer 2;2;23;24;"One cannot tell the rank of a node/leaf in a tree by simply looking at it. A reference
 taxonomy is alwys needed. We put the following in the “Material and Method” section to explain it:
 “Branching order in a tree by itself does not bring about taxonomic ranks, e,g, class or order.
 The latter can be assigned only after comparison with a reference taxonomy which is not a rigid
 framework but a modifiable system. Though a dissimilarity measure figures in the CVTree
 algorithm, it is not realistic to delineate taxa by using this measure at least for the time being.
 Even if defined in the future, it must be lineage-dependent. For example, it cannot be expected
 that the same degree of dissimilarity may be used to delineate classes in all phyla. In addition,
 monophyly is a guiding principle in comparing branching order with taxonomy. Here monophyly
 must be understood in a pragmatic way restricted to the given set of input data and the reference
 taxonomy. If all genomes from a taxon appear exclusively in a tree branch, the branch is said to
 be monophyletic.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;24;25;"The phrase “3063 identical nucleotide positions” was copied from the caption of Figure 4
 of the cited Nunoura et al. 2011 paper without much thinking. We simply deleted it."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;25;26;"The whole paragraph has been rewritten as:
 “The nanosized archaean symbiont Nanoarchaeum equitans has a highly reduced genome
 (490,885 bp [44]). It is the only described representative of a newly proposed phylum
 Nanoarchaeota and it cuts into the otherwise monophyletic phylum Euryarchaeota. We note that
 the monophyly of Euryarchaeota was also violated by Nanoarchaeum in some 16S rRNA trees,
 see, e.g., Figure 4 in a 2009 paper [61] as well as (c) and (d) in our Figure 4. It has been known
 that tiny genomes of endosymbiont microbes often tend to move towards baseline of a tree and
 distort the overall picture. In fact, we have suggested skipping such tiny genomes when studying
 bacterial phylogeny, see, e.g., [29] and a note in the home page of the CVTree Web Server [21].
 In the present case we may at most say that Nanoarchaeota probably makes a separate phylum,
 but its cutting into Euryarchaeota might be a side effect due to the tiny size of the highly
 reduced genome.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;26;27;"As a method CVTree is independent of 16S rRNA analysis. First, it uses protein products in
 a genome instead of RNA segments in the genome. Second, it does not do sequence alignment. CVTree
 generates stable trees but cannot tell which branch corresponds to what taxon. Only after comparison
 with the existing classification and nomenclature one would be able to make connections with
 taxonomy. In this sense it does depend on 16S rRNA taxonomy. Anyway, CVTree does not challenge
 16S rRNA analysis but makes it more convincing in most cases. The revealed discrepancies call for
 further study."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;27;28;"In fact, genomic approaches are more effective at species level and below due to their high
 resolution power. At high ranks CVTree may be more effective in the sense that it does not require
 additional work. Suffice it to put genomes in CVTree web server and the branches come out, then
 compare them with a reference taxonomy"

Reviewer 2;Author;3;5;0;"L244–245: I think the text within {} deviates the attention. I suggest delete that part, ending sentence
 with “monophyletic Thaumarchaeota” is also ok."
Author;Reviewer 1;4;1;1;"We thank the Reviewer for the detailed comments/suggestions given in the previous report
 and the suggestion of doing spelling-check this time. We have gone through the final manuscript
 carefully once more."
Author;Reviewer 2;4;1;1;"We changed “is in contrast with” to “is distinct from” and added a phrase “focusing on
 taxonomy of higher ranks” at the end of a sentence. Now the sentences read:
 “This is distinct from phylogeny of species in a narrow range of taxa, e.g., that of vertebrates (a
 subphylum) or human versus close relatives (a few genera). Accordingly, the phylogeny should be
 compared with taxonomy at large, or, as Cavalier-Smith \cite{cavalier-smith2002} put it,with
 “megaclassificaton” of prokaryotes, focusing on taxonomy of higher ranks.”"

Author;Reviewer 2;4;4;4;"The whole paragraph has been deleted. This paragraph was added to the revised manuscript
 because one of the Reviewers asked “Does CVTree still require input genome data to be annotated to
 gene features, i.e., protein or CDS?” Well, this question reminds us that for many so-called “Permanent
 Draft” genomes it may be worthwhile returning to our early practice of using whole genome nucleotide
 sequences without distinguishing coding and non-coding segments. Although it did not lead to better
 results as compared with using translated protein products, but it is doable on un-annotated contigs. We
 will try this later."
Author;Reviewer 2;4;5;5;"We have deleted all what appeared within the curly brackets and kept only “monophyletic
 Thaumarchaeota” as suggested. In fact, we could not tell how these words appeared there; there was
 none in our draft manuscript"
