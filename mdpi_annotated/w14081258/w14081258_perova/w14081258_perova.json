      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "The more critical issue lies in the analytical methodology used for isomers quantification. First of all, figure one is a chromatogram, not a spectrum. The chromatogram is not well resolved, i.e., there is no separation among the different analytes determined. For example, look at peaks 4, 5, and 6. There is no resolution among the isomers, the same for NP 7 and 8 and NP 8 and 10; thus, it is impossible to quantify them.\r\n If correct quantification is not assessed, then figure 1 and table 1 and 2 are not valid."

Moreover, in the subsequent sentence is reported: \"The soil was 0.25 mm-sieved to remove large particles; and then weighed series of 10 g aliquots into 250 mL brown jars\"\r\n Did you sieve the soil twice at 0.3 mm and then 0.25 mm? Why?\r\n The active soil components (lime, sand, clay) where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated is just less than 2mm. Consequently you excluded an important part of the active soil from your study, therefore your resuts are very limited.",

A total of 5 topsoil samples in each field were taken using a stainless steel spade and mixed thoroughly. Afterwards the soil samples were chosen by quartation; Then plants\u2019 debris and residues were removed. Finally soil samples were 0.3-mm sieved and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n The following was the area that the Florida soil was collected.",

Common topological indices, such as \u03ba shape indices and information indices were also calculated by Molconn-Z (version 4.12S, eduSoft, La Jolla, CA).

The results of other common topological indices calculated by Molconn-Z were shown below as well. But in this study, only the steric index (R2 = 0.82 for CN soil; R2 = 0.86 for FN soil) and IDWbar (R2 = 0.83 for CN soil; R2 = 0.94 for FN soil) have a better relationship with the half lives of the isomers, which were mentioned in the Results and Discussion part.\r\n The results of the topological indices of the isomers\r\n [35] Hall, L.

      "Author.2.4": "The analytical methodology of isomers quantification has been studied and published in former study (Wang et al., 2013). From Figure1 in Supporting Information, it seems that the isomers were not separated, but actually it does not affect the quantification of the isomers. Because the main quantitative ions were used for quantification and the main quantitative ion of each isomer were separated absolutely (Figure 1). Table 1 and Figure 1 were cited from Wang et al (2013). Moreover, series of research about the NP isomers were conducted and published afterwards. The following are the publications.",
      "Author.2.5": "It has been given in Supporting Information 2. Indeed, the characteristics of the soil are too limited. The main reason is that this experiment was conducted during my being in University of Florida, USA as a visiting scholar. My visiting time was only one year. At the end of the visiting time, I had no time to complete the microbiological test and the soil properties detection and was going to leave the United States. Worse more, the soil can not be brought to China. So I had to acquire the Florida soil properties information by website. However, the information I can acquire from the website was limited, which were shown in Supporting Information 2",

      "Author.2.9": "Indeed, in this study, the analysis of biomass and microorganism of the soil samples is essential. But I did not do that. The main reason is that this experiment was conducted during my being in University of Florida, USA as a visiting scholar. My visiting time is only one year. At the end, I had no time to complete and analysis the microbial community and biomass of the soil samples. Worse more, the soil can not be brought to China. But in the further study of the NP isomers in reclaimed water soil, this should be taken into account",
      "Author.2.10": "Accepted. Actually, the soil samples were 0.25 mm sieved. At first, the soil was 0.3 mm sieved, but the big particle size was not appropriate for the soil ultrasonic treatment of NP extraction. Therefore, 0.3mm-sieved soil was not used for the experiment(which has been deleted in the manuscript in L104). Then the soil was 0.25mm-sieved, which was suitable for the NP extraction. If the soil was 2 mm-sieved, the extraction of the NP was more inappropriate. So 0.25mm sieve was used in this study. Indeed, this size particle excluded an important part of the active soil where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated. But for this study, the degradation was completed within 30 days in both of the two soils. Therefore, though some of the organic carbon was adsorbed on the surface of the particle, the amounts of the microorganisms are enough for the degradation of NP. However, the degradation rate could be affected by this. In the future study, this would be taken into accounted. What\u2019s more, the microbial community could be taken into accounted as well",
