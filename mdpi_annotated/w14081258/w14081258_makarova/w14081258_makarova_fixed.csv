Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;There is no sampling procedure, depth, or random selection of the soils evaluated.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;Is the explanation of χ is for molecular connectivity indices or branching index?
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;The values obtained of I DW and steric hindrance are not explained.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;The more critical issue lies in the analytical methodology used for isomers quantification. First of all, figure one is a chromatogram, not a spectrum.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;5;0;"The chromatogram is not well resolved, i.e., there is no separation among the different analytes determined. For example, look at peaks 4, 5, and 6. There is no resolution among the isomers, the same for NP 7 and 8 and NP 8 and 10; thus, it is impossible to quantify them."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;6;0;If correct quantification is not assessed, then figure 1 and table 1 and 2 are not valid.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;The basic physi-chemical parameters of soils should be given.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;The irrigation water physi-chemical parameters should be given.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;The kinect models should be given.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;Figure 1 should be revised according to kinect model
Reviewer_2;Author;1;5;0;I strongly recommend the authors to analysis the biomass of the soil samples.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;"Accepted and revised in L95-105. Five-point sampling method was used in both fields (0-20cm). A total of 5 topsoil samples in each field were taken using a stainless steel spade and mixed thoroughly. Afterwards the soil samples were chosen by quartation; Then plants’ debris and residues were removed. Finally soil samples were 0.3-mm sieved and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 °C.
The following was the area that the Florida soil was collected."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;"It has been mentioned in L163-164 in the manuscript. Randic (1975) proposed molecular branching index χ, hereinafter referred to as simple molecular connectivity index (1995). Therefore, they are the same concept.

Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"Accepted and revised in L157-160. Common topological indices, such as κ shape indices and information indices were also calculated by Molconn-Z (version 4.12S, eduSoft, La Jolla, CA). The detailed list and definitions can be found in the software user’s guide [35], and the definitions can also be found in Todeschini et al. [36]. The results of other common topological indices calculated by Molconn-Z were shown below as well. But in this study, only the steric index (R2 = 0.82 for CN soil; R2 = 0.86 for FN soil) and IDWbar (R2 = 0.83 for CN soil; R2 = 0.94 for FN soil) have a better relationship with the half lives of the isomers, which were mentioned in the Results and Discussion part.

Author;Reviewer_2;2;7;1;It has been given in Supporting Information 2. Indeed, the characteristics of the soil are too limited. The main reason is that this experiment was conducted during my being in University of Florida, USA as a visiting scholar. My visiting time was only one year. At the end of the visiting time, I had no time to complete the microbiological test and the soil properties detection and was going to leave the United States. Worse more, the soil can not be brought to China. So I had to acquire the Florida soil properties information by website. However, the information I can acquire from the website was limited, which were shown in Supporting Information 2.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;8;2;"I think it is a little difficult for me to acquire the irrigation water physi-chemical parameters of Florida, but I can acquire the NP load in China irrigation water, which were cited from my former study of Wang et al., (2015). Bu in this study, the irrigation water was prepared in Lab according to the max NP concentration in reclaimed water in the study area to simulate NP in reclaimed water in the actual environment.

Author;Reviewer_2;2;9;3;It has been given in Table1.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;10;4;Accepted and revised in Figure1. All the isomers were revised according to kinect model except some isomers, such as NP2 NP5 and NP11. The degradation of these isomers were stable within the former several days, which mentioned in the manuscript. So these former points conformed to ﬁrst-order kinetic formula.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;11;5;Indeed, in this study, the analysis of biomass and microorganism of the soil samples is essential. But I did not do that. The main reason is that this experiment was conducted during my being in University of Florida, USA as a visiting scholar. My visiting time is only one year. At the end, I had no time to complete and analysis the microbial community and biomass of the soil samples. Worse more, the soil can not be brought to China. But in the further study of the NP isomers in reclaimed water soil, this should be taken into account.
Reviewer_1;Author;3;1;0;"It is fine in its present form.
It can be published."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;1;0;"I do not understand why soil samples were 0.3 mm sieved. Moreover, in the subsequent sentence is reported: ""The soil was 0.25 mm-sieved to remove large particles; and then weighed series of 10 g aliquots into 250 mL brown jars""
Did you sieve the soil twice at 0.3 mm and then 0.25 mm? Why?
The active soil components (lime, sand, clay) where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated is just less than 2mm. Consequently you excluded an important part of the active soil from your study, therefore your resuts are very limited."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;2;0;Figure 1 legends of axis need font size larger, please make readable the figures
Author;Reviewer_2;4;1;1;Accepted. Actually, the soil samples were 0.25 mm sieved. At first, the soil was 0.3 mm sieved, but the big particle size was not appropriate for the soil ultrasonic treatment of NP extraction. Therefore, 0.3mm-sieved soil was not used for the experiment(which has been deleted in the manuscript in L104). Then the soil was 0.25mm-sieved, which was suitable for the NP extraction. If the soil was 2 mm-sieved, the extraction of the NP was more inappropriate. So 0.25mm sieve was used in this study. Indeed, this size particle excluded an important part of the active soil where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated. But for this study, the degradation was completed within 30 days in both of the two soils. Therefore, though some of the organic carbon was adsorbed on the surface of the particle, the amounts of the microorganisms are enough for the degradation of NP. However, the degradation rate could be affected by this. In the future study, this would be taken into accounted. What’s more, the microbial community could be taken into accounted as well. 
Author;Reviewer_2;4;2;2;Accepted and revised in L204. Figure 1 has been changed in the manuscript.
