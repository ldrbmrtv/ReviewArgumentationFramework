Why?\nThe active soil components (lime, sand, clay) where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated is just less than 2mm. Consequently you excluded an important part of the active soil from your study, therefore your resuts are very limited.",

      "Author.4.1": "Accepted. Actually, the soil samples were 0.25 mm sieved. At first, the soil was 0.3 mm sieved, but the big particle size was not appropriate for the soil ultrasonic treatment of NP extraction. Therefore, 0.3mm-sieved soil was not used for the experiment(which has been deleted in the manuscript in L104). Then the soil was 0.25mm-sieved, which was suitable for the NP extraction. If the soil was 2 mm-sieved, the extraction of the NP was more inappropriate. So 0.25mm sieve was used in this study. Indeed, this size particle excluded an important part of the active soil where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated. But for this study, the degradation was completed within 30 days in both of the two soils. Therefore, though some of the organic carbon was adsorbed on the surface of the particle, the amounts of the microorganisms are enough for the degradation of NP. However, the degradation rate could be affected by this. In the future study, this would be taken into accounted. What\u2019s more, the microbial community could be taken into accounted as well. ",
