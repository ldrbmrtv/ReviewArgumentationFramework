Author;Reviewer_2;2;19;1;We prefer to keep the introduction in order to give a broad overview to readers
Author;Reviewer_2;2;20;2;"The cluster analysis is based on phenotypic traits, this analysis revealed specific clusters of ""Cornetto di Pontecorvo"" and similar types, although they were not clearly separated at the hierarchical level. The genotyping analysis provided more in-depth insights. We addressed this in the discussions section (see L485 and subsequent)."
