Although our study integrates components of both strategies, the authors still think, that the \nsequential exploratory strategy describes our methods better than the convergent parallel design \n(see also: Curry et al Circ. Cardiovasc, Qual. Outcomes 2013, 6:119-123). ",
      "Author.2.2": "The manuscript has been changed accordingly.\n",

      "Author.2.4": "The reviewer is right. The phase has been changed into the \u201canalysis\u201d of compounding factors",
      "Author.2.5": "The authors followed the reviewer\u2019s suggestions and re-wrote this para as follows: \u201cThe overall objective of this study was to investigate the today\u2019s medical students \nattitudes towards AI and other digital working tools. We wanted to understand if age, gender, \nsemester level and curriculum type influences their views. This study also assembled \ninformation on students\u2019 understanding of AI algorithms and digital applications in health care \nand assessed their level of confidence in working alongside these tools after graduation in \npatient care. It is our belief that this information may possess the means to employ digital tools \nincluding AI into the curriculum of medical students efficiently, enhancing their confidence in \nusing them and therefor to better equip our future physicians with sufficient knowledge.\u201d ",

The intention was - as outlined in the \ninitial manuscript version - \u201c\u2026 to understand how they perceive the subject of interest\u201d. The \nwording has been specified, to clarify that in total 8 students tested the items but not 4 as the \nreviewer assumed. This number was considered sufficient a) to detect inconsistencies and b) to \nverify the correct meaning of the questions. AG and JE are two of the authors (first letter of the \nfirst and last name). In order to avoid any misunderstanding, this has been changed to \u201cthe \nauthors\u201d in the revised manuscript.",
      "Author.2.8": "Convenience sampling is defined as a method to collect data from a conveniently available pool of respondents. We used it, because it is the most commonly used \nsampling technique as it's incredibly prompt, uncomplicated, and economical.",

      "Author.2.10": "The sampling procedure was clearly described in the initial manuscript. For phase 1: \n\u201cAll participants of the first phase were students from from 1st to 6th year (undergraduate 1st to \n2th year, graduate 3th to 6th year) from German Universities. The inclusion criteria were to \nactively study medicine and their agreement for their voluntarily participation. In the same way, \nthe exclusion criteria were to have suspended their studies, as well as other exceptional \nsituations. Prior to start, informed consent was obtained, which was followed by the collection \nof telephone numbers and email addresses. ... They were selected purposely and consecutively, \nin part by snowball until theoretical saturation was reached.\u201d For phase 2: \u201cFor the second, \nquantitative study phase identical inclusion/exclusion criteria applied.\u201d This referred to medical \nstudents of all semesters, excluding students from other faculties. \u201cThe online survey was sent \nto all medical faculties in Germany from which most forwarded the survey invitation by email \nto about 80 000 medical students to fulfill the principle of maximum diversity through \nconvenience sampling method. Each contained an invitation letter and an information sheet.\u201d \nSurely, sampling procedures in mixed method studies are phase depended different.\n",
      "Author.2.11": "The statement has been changed into: \u201cThe focus on German educational system and the fact that \nonly a small fraction of the total number of medical students filled out the online survey makes \na generalization of the answers difficult\u201d.",

      "Author.2.14": "The authors fully agree. Therefore, the conclusion paragraph has been split into the \u201cConclusion\u201d paragraph, in which the study\u2019s conclusions has been outlined, and into a the new \npara \u201cImplications\u201d where the usefulness of the integration of eHealth aspects (including AI) \ninto the curriculum is discussed.\n",
