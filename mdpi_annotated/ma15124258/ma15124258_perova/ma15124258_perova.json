    "Reviewer_1": {
      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "1. How do the WAXS and SAXS differ? How do these experiments differentiate between increasing the number of defects and the size of the defects?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "2. The authors mention cracks as well as voids. How are the cracks differentiated from the voids? Were voids observed? Could computed microtomography be used to confirm some of the experimental results?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "3. Are your pores assumed to be spherical? Are cracks cylindrical. Are they statistical in nature?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "4. I would be interesting to have additional support for the process by using thermal experiments such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). How do you results compare to phase transformation measured using DSC? Are the onsets and finishing of the phase transformations consistent with the DSC measurements?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "5. Do your experiments (WAXS and SAXS) measure the defect size and number of defects or is a model used to infer these quantities?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "6. What do the colors in your figures represent?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "7. Could there be any other explanation rather than increase in number of internal nano-scale pores? Could the increase be due to larger defects rather than an increase in the number of defects? If so, how do you prove this? Could you use X-ray microtomography on your samples?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "8. Is the temperature high enough to cause decomposition effects? If so, do the decomposition products form bubbles in your solvent? If so, could this bias your conclusions?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.9": "9. Can you explain why an increase in scattering intensity indicates increase in more small voids rather than an increase in existing void sizes?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.10": "10. Could you be more specific on the \"spherical model\" on line 170? Co you assume the pore volume remains unchanged, but the number increases? or visa verse?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.11": "11. What do you mean by \u201care calculated\u201d on line 199? What are the basic equations and assumptions for this calculation?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.12": "12. Again, what is happening? Are the number of pores increasing or is the existing pores increasing in volume?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.13": "I also noticed that your references did not include any of the more recent work published in 2021 or 2022. There are some more recent articles that would be worth citing."
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "In the introduction, the authors foreground their work, focusing on the relationship between the presence of pores and sensitivity. It indeed the case, but I could not find any discussion on this issue. Therefore, I suggest include some comments on this and, probably, provide some discussion of how to avoid the increase of such defects, which increase sensitivity of energetic crystals, in particular CL-20."
    },
    "Reviewer_3": {
      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "1. Section 2.1. Materials and instruments, you need to specify the particle size of the initial CL-20 powders.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "2. \u201cThe electron density of \u03b5-CL-20 crystal form is 622.7 nm-3 and that of \u03b3-CL-20 is 584.8 nm-3, while the electron density of GPL107 is 571.7 nm-3\u201d You need to specify the reference in which this data were obtained.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.3": "3. Page 6. 199-198 \u201cThe specific surface area and volume fraction of pores are calculated, and the results are shown in figure 7.\u201d From the text of the manuscript it is not clear what method was used to obtain the calculated data on the specific surface area and volume fraction of pores.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.4": "4. The conclusion must be supplemented with a forecast about the change in the performance of the SL-20 in terms of safety and suitability for use after temperature effects."
    },
    "Author": {
      "Author.2.1": "Thanks for you comments, and I have added the particle size in the manuscript.",
      "Author.2.2": "The electron density of CL 20 and GPL107 are calculated according to the classical electron radius ( with a size of 2.818 E 13 cm) and the electron number per volume, the detailed information can refer to our previous work (Molecules 2020, 25 , 443.)",
      "Author.2.3": "In our previous work (Molecules 2020, 25, 443.), we described in detail how to calculate the specific surface area and volume fraction. In this paper, the same method was used to calculate the specific surface area and volume fraction, so we did not repeat how to calculator, just added the reference in the manuscript.",
      "Author.2.4": "We have supplemented with a forecast about the change in the performance of the CL 20 in terms of safety and suitability for use after thermal\r\n treatment in the conclusion. \u201cDuring the thermal treatment, the nano--scale pores increase obviously, which will seriously increase the sensitivity of CL--20, and make a dangerous to the explosive charges with CL--20. To improve the application performance of CL--20, we should try to avoid the increase of such defects, such as storing in an constant low temperature to avoid the thermal expansion, and avoid any phase transition.\u201d",
      "Author.2.5": "SAXS can be used to measure the defect size and number of defects with rational theory and adequate validation in many field.",
      "Author.2.6": "The colors in figure 1 and 3 represent the strength of scattering, while the colors in other figures just represent different date.",
      "Author.2.7": "The result of SAXS is a reflection of two phase with different electron density. In our paper, the CL 20 powders are immersed in GPL107 with a approximately equal electron density with CL 20 crystals, so the SAXS reflects the nano scale pores inside CL 20 powders. Thereby, the increase of strength in SAXS curve reflects the increase in number of internal nano scale pores. According to the principle of SAXS, the scale of defects is correlated with the q range, so the growth into larger defects will appear in other q range. X ray microtomography is usually used to confirm the voids in micron scale but this paper focuses on nano scale voids.",
      "Author.2.8": "The GPL107 is resistant to high temperatures about 400 \u2103, and we used the SAXS patterns of GPL107 at different temperature as the background to correct any bias at different temperature.",
      "Author.2.9": "According to the principle of SAXS, the scale of defects is correlated with the q range, so the increase in scattering intensity in lager q range can be explained into the increase in more small voids. And also, our fitting result can provide more obvious display.",
      "Author.2.10": "In our paper, spherical model was just a choice in the SAXS date fitting, so we did not provide more illustrate, but a reference (L A Feigin and D I Svergun, Structure Analysis by Small Angle X Ray and Neutron Scattering, Plenum Press, New York, 1987) was provide in the manuscript. On line 173, we gave a conclusion \u201cthe number of pores increased, but the size distribution did not change.\u201d We did not\r\n consider the pore volume, but we can deduce that the pores volume increase as the increase of the number of pores.",
      "Author.2.11": "In our previous work (Molecules 2020, 25, 443.), we described in detail how to calculate the specific surface area and volume fraction. In this paper, the same method was used to calculate the specific surface area and volume fraction, so we did not repeat how to calculator, just added the reference in the manuscript.",
      "Author.2.12": "Thanks again for your attention, According to the principle of SAXS, the scale of defects is correlated with the q range, so the increase in scattering intensity without the change of q range can be explained into the number of pores increasing, while the existing pores increasing in volume would result into an change of q to low range.",
      "Author.2.13": "Thanks for your comments, we added three reference about recent work published in 2021 and 2022.",
