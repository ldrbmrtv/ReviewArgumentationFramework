      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "I would like to suggest authors label inoculation points in Figure 1, which could give readers a clear view of three different inoculation methods.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "Line 142: \u201cproportion of PPSD\u201d should be \u201cproportion of PSD or PPSD",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Line 143: \u201cPPSD-premature spike death\u201d should be \u201cPPSD-proportion of premature spike death\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "Lines 168 - 169: Should it be that DON content of most lines without Fhb1 exceeded 1000 \u03bcg/kg under UBFI? Where is 4224.38 \u03bcg/kg in Table 1? Do you mean in Table S1?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "Lines 411 & 413: \u201cPPSB\u201d should be \u201cPPSD\u201d.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "I would suggest to avoid citing supplementary figures at the beginning of the chapter.\r\n See for example chapter 2.4. Given that 2.4 chapter discusses data of supplementary figure 4 would suggest to make figure S4 as Figure 4 of the manuscript",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "To further clarify the infection methods a supplementary figure detailing graphically the modes of inoculation with figures would make the paper extremely useful for the community",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Identity of the strain used for infection should be confirmed: a multilocus species characterisation is needed to confirm the species of the strain or a reference to a publication where the strain was described and appropriately characterised.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Mycotoxin data analysis should be provided (I guess is policy of mdpi to make raw data available together with the publication)"
