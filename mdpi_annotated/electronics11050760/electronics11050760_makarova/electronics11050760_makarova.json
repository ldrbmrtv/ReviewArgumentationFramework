      "Author.4.1": "According to reviewer\u2019s comment, we the following sentences at the end of the Introduction.\r\n\u201cIn this paper, we analyze the number of multiplications of the existing fast transform methods in the VVC standard, and we propose a new fast inverse transform using the number\r\nof non-zero coefficients based on linearity to reduce the number of multiplications.\u201d",
      "Author.4.2": "According to reviewer\u2019s comment, we added Discussion Section.\r\n4. Discussion\r\nThe previously proposed fast methods were mainly addressed to reduce complexity\r\nin the video encoder with the BD-rate loss. In [29], a fast intra mode decision algorithm was proposed and the result showed the encoding time savings of 51%~53% with BD-rate loss of\r\n0.93%~1.08%. A low-complexity CTU (Coding Tree Unit) partition structure decision and fast\r\nintra mode decision were proposed in [30] and showed the average encoding time saving of\r\n63% with the BD-rate loss of 1.93%. The fast encoders for video coding reduce only the encoder\r\ncomplexity but the BD-rates were always increased without decreasing the decoder\r\ncomplexity. However, the proposed fast inverse transform is different from the fast encoders\r\nin that it reduces the complexity in both the encoder and decoder while maintaining the BD-\r\nrate of the VVC standard. In the RA configuration, the proposed method reduces the average\r\nencoding and decoding times by approximately (4, 10) %, respectively, while maintaining\r\naverage BD-rates.\r\nIf the proposed inverse transform using the number of non-zero coefficients is applied to the\r\nVVC standard, the inverse transform of the VVC standard should be changed to include the\r\nproposed method. This fact can be demerit. However, the proposed method can be considered\r\nin the next-generation video coding standards because it achieves decoding run-time saving,\r\nwhile maintaining average BD-rate. In addition to that, the proposed method is more effective\r\nin high QP value than in low QP value, because the higher the QP value is, the fewer no-zero\r\ncoefficients there are.",
