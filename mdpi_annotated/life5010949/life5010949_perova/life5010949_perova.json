      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "I would\r\n like to see a comparison with at least one regular alignment/treeing method, based on the same genomes\r\n the authors used, and not just a visual topological comparison with other published trees.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "As far as I can see, statistical support on the branches is missing, so I have no way of assessing if this\r\n branching order is valid. Bootstrapping or jackknifing are by no means the final word on the significance\r\n of branches, however an explanation as to how the user should assess the significance of braches would\r\n be good, i.e., branch length.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The fact that Thermofilum is placed outside Crenarchaeota in Figures 3 and 4 is a little disturbing. I\r\n haven\u2019t come across such a placement in other phylogenetic analyses of Archaea, for example in\r\n Brochier-Armanet et al 2008 Nat Rev Microb, or Rinke et al. 2013 Nature. I believe this needs to better\r\n explained in the manuscript, rather than just saying \u201cthis fact is noted\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "I am also not very convinced with the placement of Nanoarchaeota. It seems like this phylum is\r\n moving around with the addition of new sequence data (for example in Rinke et al. Figure 2 tree, they\r\n are on an entirely different branch than Euryarchaeota). Though the authors also rightfully point out that\r\n the reduced genome size may have something to do with this placement.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "The placement of Halobacteria (due to interfering Nanoarchaeota, I presume) is also a little\r\n disturbing. I would recommend that the authors provide a discussion of this. Especially with regards to\r\n other archaeal trees. For instance, in the tree of Armanet et al 2011 that the authors also refer to, the\r\n placement of Halobacteria with respect to Nanoarchaeota is very different.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "In summary, I find the piece interesting, but parts of the discussion are rather weak, therefore I am\r\n suggesting a major revision. Another reason for major revision is the style that the manuscript is written.\r\n I am not a native speaker, but given that I had to read sentences several times, I suspect the manuscript\r\n can benefit from an English language check.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "I would really appreciate a \u201cMethods\u201d part where the CVTree is explained shortly, and the\r\n tree-viewer is explained with more detail. The absence of branch lengths and bootstraps should be\r\n discussed here. Other technical aspects of the paper (e.g., sequence dataset), parameters, criteria ... all\r\n could be well organized in this part.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Archaeal phylogeny has already been studied in detail, with 16S and other marker genes, and with\r\n genomic approaches too. Some of the undersigning authors had already published on this before,\r\n although with smaller input datasets. Therefore, the fact that 16S topology is quite stable and\r\n comparable with other approaches is already known.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Taxonomists have traditionally circumscribed the high taxa (specially orders and classes) with great\r\n subjectivity, i.e., without well accepted criteria. In terms of phylogenetic trees one premise has always\r\n been clear, a taxon must be monophyletic. This principle has been used in the present work to reconsider\r\n the status of some high taxa. However, authors do not explain objective criteria to properly interpret the\r\n rank of the clades, which impedes making a profound evaluation of the archaeal classification.\r\n Therefore, although authors have strong tools and dataset, they just achieved a small revision of the high\r\n taxa which is, indeed, quite biased by the underlying 16S guidelines.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "I have noted some lack of scientific rigor according to: many wrong taxonomic names and typos,\r\n scarce figure legends, few comments about the missing branch lengths or bootstraps (!), redundancy in\r\n text and figures and fragments which are really difficult to understand. Authors should pay attention to\r\n language, explanations and text organization.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Authors shouldn't forget (particularly in conclusion) that the resolution power of 16S for high ranks\r\n (genus and above) is currently well accepted. And the number of non-redundant 16S entries available is\r\n much much larger than that of archaeal genomes. 16s data offer a much comprehensive view of the\r\n archaeal diversity, including deep branches.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.8": "The figure legends require more rigorous explanation. Would be interesting to remember that the\r\n branch lengths are not taken into account, or were omitted.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.10": "Figure 1 is a bit redundant. A short comment about the inclusion of that particular sequence into the\r\n Thermoplasmatales can be added into the legend of Figure 2.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.11": "However, the reclassification of Methanomassiliicoccus into Thermoplasmataceae needs more\r\n explanation. To be objective, authors should address the following question, why in the same family and\r\n not in another new family?",

      "Reviewer_2.1.17": "L146: No need to explain the 6+2 if it is properly explained in the figure legend.\r\n Figure 3 is redundant. I would recommend to avoid presenting different versions of the same tree; just\r\n the final tree is OK (use final/valid labels) and all important explanations in the text or legend. Perhaps\r\n the whole reasoning in Lines 142\u2013180 is not so relevant for the current objective of comparing CVT,\r\n LTP, Bergeys? Or, perhaps, define this objective more clearly.",

If I understood right, there was good support for Candidatus Aciduliprofundum as part of\r\n a clade called DHEV2, which is a sister clade of Thermoplasmatales. However in the present work the\r\n authors intend here to reclassify Aciduliprofundum into family Thermococcaceae of Thermococcales.\r\n This needs further explanation. Since the new affiliation is quite in disagreement with previous\r\n observations, and this is not properly justified in the results/discussion, the final statement \u201cthis\r\n modification would hold as long as no new facts challenge it\u201d seems unacceptable.

      "Author.2.1": "A \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d section has been added where the CVTree algorithm, the\r\n interactive tree-viewer, statistical resampling tests (bootstrap, jackknife), calibration of branch\r\n lengths, etc., were discussed in slightly more detail.",
      "Author.2.2": "Yes, 16S rRNA phylogeny is quite stable and it almost defines the present taxonomy.\r\n We have given due credit for this. In general, CVTree does not challenge 16S rRNA analysis but\r\n complement it.",
      "Author.2.3": "A robust phylogenetic tree comes with a fixed branching order of leaves. One looks at the\r\n leaf names and their taxonomic lineage and tries to map the latter to the branches. To this end we\r\n added the following paragraphs in the \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d section.\r\n \u201cThere are two aspects of a phylogenetic tree: the branching order (topology) and the branch\r\n lengths. Branching order is related to classification and branch length to evolution time.\r\n Calibration of branch lengths is always associated with the assumption that mutation rate\r\n remains more or less a constant across all species represented in a tree, an assumption that\r\n cannot hold true in a large-scale phylogenetic study like the present one. Therefore, branching\r\n order in trees is of primary concern, whereas calibration of branch lengths makes less sense.\r\n Accordingly, all figures in this paper only show the branching scheme without indication of\r\n branch lengths and bootstrap values.\u201d\r\n \u201cBranching order in a tree by itself does not bring about taxonomic ranks, e,g, class or order.\r\n The latter can be assigned only after comparison with a reference taxonomy which is not a rigid\r\n framework but a modifiable system. Though a dissimilarity measure figures in the CVTree\r\n algorithm, it is not realistic to delineate taxa by using this measure at least for the time being.\r\n Even if defined in the future, it must be lineage-dependent. For example, it cannot be expected\r\n that the same degree of dissimilarity may be used to delineate classes in all phyla. In addition,\r\n monophyly is a guiding principle in comparing branching order with taxonomy. Here monophyly\r\n must be understood in a pragmatic way restricted to the given set of input data and the reference\r\n taxonomy. If all genomes from a taxon appear exclusively in a tree branch, the branch is said to\r\n be monophyletic.\u201d",
      "Author.2.4": "We have reorganized the manuscript mainly by adding a new \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d\r\n section where discussions on branch length, statistical resampling, meaning and choice of K, etc.,\r\n were given.

      "Author.2.5": "A few more sentences were added in the \u201cConclusion\u201d regarding the power and\r\n achievement of the 16S rRNA analysis.",
      "Author.2.6": "We tried to rephrase the paragraph by changing, deleting, or adding a few words as follows:\r\n \u201cIn this paper we study Archaea phylogeny across many phyla. This is in contrast with\r\n phylogeny of species in a narrow range of taxa, e.g., that of vertebrates (a subphylum) or human\r\n versus close relatives (a few genera). Accordingly, the phylogeny should be compared with\r\n taxonomy at large, or, as Cavalier-Smith (citing cavalier-smith 2002) put it, with\r\n \u201cmegaclassificaton\u201d of prokaryotes. Although in taxonomy the description of a newly discovered\r\n organism necessarily starts from the lower ranks, higher rank assignments are often incomplete\r\n or lacking. At present the ranks above class are not covered by the Bacteriological Code. The\r\n number of plausible microbial phyla may reach hundreds and archaeal ones are among the less\r\n studied. According to the 16S rRNA analysis, the major archaeal classes and their subordinate\r\n orders have been more or less delineated. Therefore, in order to carry out the aforementioned\r\n cross verification we make emphasis on higher ranks such as phyla, classes, and orders. A study\r\n using 179 Archaea genomes should provide a framework for further study of lower ranks.\u201d",
      "Author.2.7": "Branching order in a tree is directly related to taxonomy, while branch lengths have more\r\n to do with evolution. For large-scale phylogenetic study across many phyla the former is more\r\n important than the calibration of branch lengths.\r\n The latter is based on the assumption that mutation rate is more or less constant. This assumption\r\n cannot hold when dealing with many phyla.",

      "Author.2.15": "We have rewritten the paragraph as:\r\n \u201cThe new phylum Korarchaeota violates the monophyly of the phylum Crenarchaeota by\r\n drawing to itself the family Thermofilaceae. However, in an on-going study of ours (not\r\n published yet) using a much larger data set, this violation no longer shows up; both\r\n Korarchaeota and Crenarchaeota restore their phylum status. Taking into account the fact that\r\n both Korarchaeota and Thermofilaceae are represented by single species for the time being,\r\n their placement certainly requires further study with broader sampling of genomes.\u201d",
      "Author.2.16": "From the original Figures 3 and 4 only one has been kept and the legend rewritten. In fact,\r\n the whole paragraph changed to:\r\n \u201cThe newly proposed phylum Thaumarchaeota appears to be non-monophyletic as an outlying\r\n strain Candidatus Caldiarchaeum subterranum was assigned to this phylum according to the\r\n NCBI taxonomy. The NCBI assignment might reflect its position in some phylogenetic tree based\r\n on concatenated proteins, e.g., Figure 2 in [\u2026]. However, in the original paper reporting the\r\n discovery of this strain [\u2026] and in recent 16S rRNA studies, e.g., [\u2026], Candidatus\r\n Caldiarchaeum subterranum was proposed to make a new phylum Aigarchaeota. CVTrees\r\n support the introduction of this new phylum. A lineage modification of Candidatus\r\n Caldiarchaeum subterranum from Thaumarchaeota to Aigarchaeota would lead to a\r\n monophyletic Thaumarchaeota{7}.\u201d",
      "Author.2.17": "The problem of taxonomic placement of Aciduliprofundum is a good example to\r\n demonstrate how one extract information from CVTrees. In the Reysenbach et al. Nature 2006 paper it\r\n was taken as the first cultivated member of the DHEV2 (deep-sea hydrothermal euryarchaeate 2)\r\n clade based on a maximum-likelihood 16S rRNA tree. Unfortunately, all other 13 members of this\r\n clade were represented by 16S rRNA sequences only and no genome data are available so far. The\r\n NCBI taxonomy gave an incomplete lineage: Archaea; Euryrchaeota; unclassified Euryarchaeota;\r\n missing taxonomic assignment at the rank class and below.\r\n In order to make use of CVTree we must touch on the K-issue a little more. The alignment-free\r\n comparison of genomes in CVTree is implemented by counting the number of K-peptides in the protein\r\n products encoded in a genome followed by subtraction of a random background caused by neutral\r\n mutations. The peptide length K looks like a parameter, but it is actually not a parameter. Using a\r\n longer K emphasizes species-specificity, while a shorter K takes into account more common features\r\n with neighboring species. However, we never adjust K: a fixed K is used for all genomes to construct a\r\n tree, but one may construct a series of trees for K = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \u2026 We have shown repeatedly that\r\n R9\r\n K = 5 and 6 lead to best results in the sense of agreement with taxonomy, so usually only a K = 6 tree\r\n is given in publications.\r\n Let us look at a subtree, i.e., part of a tree, containing the organisms of interest. If the branching\r\n order in all trees built for different Ks turns out to be same, it would be a strong support to the\r\n branching order. In most cases the branching order varies with K: K = 3 and 4 make sense, K = 5 and\r\n 6 yield the best, K = 7 and 8 become slightly worse, etc. For too big a K, even if the closest strains\r\n remain grouped together the whole tree may tend to become a star-tree, i.e., every small clade stands\r\n in its own and their mutual placements become less meaningful. Therefore, inspection of trees for a\r\n range of K-values provides an additional dimension to evaluate the results.\r\n For Aciduprofumdum we have a stable pair\r\n (<C>Thermococci{18}, <G>Aciduprofumdum{2}) at K=3, 5, 6, 7.\r\n At K = 4 we have\r\n (<C>Thermococci{18}, (<G>Staphylothermus{2}, <G>Aciduprofundum{2}))\r\n In all these cases Thermoplasmata stands farther away from the above pair. However, at K = 8 and\r\n 9, when the overall tree picture has been largely distorted, Aciduliprofundum does stand closer to\r\n Thermaplasmata. Putting together all the above results we tend to consider the pair\r\n (<C>Thermococci{18}, <G>Aciduliprofundum{2}) as reflecting a more probable relation. Confined\r\n to the available data for the time being one may assign <G>Aciduliprofundum to <C>Thermococci,\r\n e.g., to denote the pair as\r\n <C>Thermococci{20}=(<F>Thermococcaceae{18}, <G>Aciduliprofundum{2})\r\n leaving its family unclassified or assign it to a new family. Without further phenotypic and\r\n chemotaxonomic evidence it is better not to introduce new taxon names if the present naming scheme\r\n is capable to accommodate the leaves without conflict. This was why we wrote \u201cthis modification\r\n would hold as long as no new facts challenge it\u201d. Anyway, taxonomy has always been a work in\r\n progress. One has to be prepared for modifications when new data appear. To make a long story\r\n short, we have rewritten the paragraph as:\r\n \u201cThe Candidatus genus Aciduliprofundum is considered a member of the DHEV2 (deap-sea\r\n hydrothermal vent euryarchaeotic 2) phylogenetic cluster. No taxonomic information was given\r\n in the original papers [55,56]. The NCBI Taxonomy did not provide definite lineage information\r\n for this taxon at the class, order, and family ranks. According to [55] the whole DHEV2 cluster\r\n was located close to Thermoplamatales in a maximum-likelihood analysis of 16S rRNA\r\n sequences. A similar placement was seen in [54] where a Bayesian tree of the archaeal domain\r\n based on concatenation of 57 ribosomal proteins put a lonely Aciduliprofundum next to\r\n Thermoplasmata. However, in CVTrees, constructed for all K-values from 3 to 9,\r\n Aciduliprofundum juxstaposes with the class Thermococci{18}. An observation in [56] that this\r\n organism shares a rare lipid structure with a few species from Thermococcales may hint on its\r\n possible association with the latter. If we temporarily presume a lineage\r\n <C>Thermococci<O>Unclassified<F>Unclassified<G>Aciduliprofundum\u2026\r\n R10\r\n one might have a monophyletic class <C>Thermococci{20}. Since none of the 13 DHEV2\r\n members listed in [55] has a sequenced genome so far, CVTree cannot tell the placement of the\r\n DHEV2 cluster as a whole for the time being. It remains an open problem as whether DHEV2 is\r\n close to Thermoplasmata or to Thermococci, or a new class is needed to accommodate DHEV2.\u201d",

If all genomes from a taxon appear exclusively in a tree branch, the branch is said to\r\n be monophyletic.\u201d",
      "Author.2.24": "The phrase \u201c3063 identical nucleotide positions\u201d was copied from the caption of Figure 4\r\n of the cited Nunoura et al. 2011 paper without much thinking. We simply deleted it.",
      "Author.2.25": "The whole paragraph has been rewritten as:\r\n \u201cThe nanosized archaean symbiont Nanoarchaeum equitans has a highly reduced genome\r\n (490,885 bp [44]). It is the only described representative of a newly proposed phylum\r\n Nanoarchaeota and it cuts into the otherwise monophyletic phylum Euryarchaeota. We note that\r\n the monophyly of Euryarchaeota was also violated by Nanoarchaeum in some 16S rRNA trees,\r\n see, e.g., Figure 4 in a 2009 paper [61] as well as (c) and (d) in our Figure 4. It has been known\r\n that tiny genomes of endosymbiont microbes often tend to move towards baseline of a tree and\r\n distort the overall picture. In fact, we have suggested skipping such tiny genomes when studying\r\n bacterial phylogeny, see, e.g., [29] and a note in the home page of the CVTree Web Server [21].\r\n In the present case we may at most say that Nanoarchaeota probably makes a separate phylum,\r\n but its cutting into Euryarchaeota might be a side effect due to the tiny size of the highly\r\n reduced genome.\u201d",
      "Author.2.26": "As a method CVTree is independent of 16S rRNA analysis. First, it uses protein products in\r\n a genome instead of RNA segments in the genome. Second, it does not do sequence alignment. CVTree\r\n generates stable trees but cannot tell which branch corresponds to what taxon. Only after comparison\r\n with the existing classification and nomenclature one would be able to make connections with\r\n taxonomy. In this sense it does depend on 16S rRNA taxonomy. Anyway, CVTree does not challenge\r\n 16S rRNA analysis but makes it more convincing in most cases. The revealed discrepancies call for\r\n further study.",
      "Author.2.27": "In fact, genomic approaches are more effective at species level and below due to their high\r\n resolution power. At high ranks CVTree may be more effective in the sense that it does not require\r\n additional work. Suffice it to put genomes in CVTree web server and the branches come out, then\r\n compare them with a reference taxonomy",
