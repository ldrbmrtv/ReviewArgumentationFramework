      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "I think the alignment-free methodology is interesting, however I would like to see a comparison with at least one regular alignment/treeing method, based on the same genomes \nthe authors used, and not just a visual topological comparison with other published trees.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "As far as I can see, statistical support on the branches is missing, so I have no way of assessing if this \nbranching order is valid. Bootstrapping or jackknifing are by no means the final word on the significance \nof branches, however an explanation as to how the user should assess the significance of braches would \nbe good, i.e., branch length.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The fact that Thermofilum is placed outside Crenarchaeota in Figures 3 and 4 is a little disturbing. I \nhaven\u2019t come across such a placement in other phylogenetic analyses of Archaea, for example in \nBrochier-Armanet et al 2008 Nat Rev Microb, or Rinke et al. 2013 Nature. I believe this needs to better \nexplained in the manuscript, rather than just saying \u201cthis fact is noted\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "I am also not very convinced with the placement of Nanoarchaeota. It seems like this phylum is \nmoving around with the addition of new sequence data (for example in Rinke et al. Figure 2 tree, they \nare on an entirely different branch than Euryarchaeota). Though the authors also rightfully point out that \nthe reduced genome size may have something to do with this placement.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "The placement of Halobacteria (due to interfering Nanoarchaeota, I presume) is also a little \ndisturbing. I would recommend that the authors provide a discussion of this. Especially with regards to \nother archaeal trees. For instance, in the tree of Armanet et al 2011 that the authors also refer to, the \nplacement of Halobacteria with respect to Nanoarchaeota is very different.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "In summary, I find the piece interesting, but parts of the discussion are rather weak, therefore I am \nsuggesting a major revision. Another reason for major revision is the style that the manuscript is written. \nI am not a native speaker, but given that I had to read sentences several times, I suspect the manuscript \ncan benefit from an English language check.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "I would really appreciate a \u201cMethods\u201d part where the CVTree is explained shortly, and the \ntree-viewer is explained with more detail. The absence of branch lengths and bootstraps should be \ndiscussed here. Other technical aspects of the paper (e.g., sequence dataset), parameters, criteria ... all \ncould be well organized in this part.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Archaeal phylogeny has already been studied in detail, with 16S and other marker genes, and with \ngenomic approaches too. Some of the undersigning authors had already published on this before, \nalthough with smaller input datasets. Therefore, the fact that 16S topology is quite stable and \ncomparable with other approaches is already known.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Taxonomists have traditionally circumscribed the high taxa (specially orders and classes) with great \nsubjectivity, i.e., without well accepted criteria. In terms of phylogenetic trees one premise has always \nbeen clear, a taxon must be monophyletic. This principle has been used in the present work to reconsider \nthe status of some high taxa. However, authors do not explain objective criteria to properly interpret the \nrank of the clades, which impedes making a profound evaluation of the archaeal classification. \nTherefore, although authors have strong tools and dataset, they just achieved a small revision of the high \ntaxa which is, indeed, quite biased by the underlying 16S guidelines.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "I have noted some lack of scientific rigor according to: many wrong taxonomic names and typos, \nscarce figure legends, few comments about the missing branch lengths or bootstraps (!), redundancy in \ntext and figures and fragments which are really difficult to understand. Authors should pay attention to \nlanguage, explanations and text organization.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "Authors shouldn't forget (particularly in conclusion) that the resolution power of 16S for high ranks \n(genus and above) is currently well accepted. And the number of non-redundant 16S entries available is \nmuch much larger than that of archaeal genomes. 16s data offer a much comprehensive view of the \narchaeal diversity, including deep branches.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.13": "However, the reclassification of Methanomassiliicoccus into Thermoplasmataceae needs more \nexplanation. To be objective, authors should address the following question, why in the same family and \nnot in another new family?",

      "Reviewer_2.1.17": "Add more explanations in legend of Figure3.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.18": "L143: Sounds clearer if you avoid mixing class and phylum, for example: \u201cThe placement of \nphylum Korarchaeota, as a closest neighbor of family Thermofilaceae, violates the monophyly of \nphylum Crenarchaeota.\u201d",
      "Reviewer_2.1.19": "L146: No need to explain the 6+2 if it is properly explained in the figure legend. \nFigure 3 is redundant. I would recommend to avoid presenting different versions of the same tree; just \nthe final tree is OK (use final/valid labels) and all important explanations in the text or legend. Perhaps \nthe whole reasoning in Lines 142\u2013180 is not so relevant for the current objective of comparing CVT, \nLTP, Bergeys? Or, perhaps, define this objective more clearly.",

However in the present work the \nauthors intend here to reclassify Aciduliprofundum into family Thermococcaceae of Thermococcales. \nThis needs further explanation. Since the new affiliation is quite in disagreement with previous \nobservations, and this is not properly justified in the results/discussion, the final statement \u201cthis \nmodification would hold as long as no new facts challenge it\u201d seems unacceptable.

      "Author.2.1": "Multi-alignment of concatenated protein (or DNA) segments is a genome-scale, but not \nwhole-genome approach. Its applicability depends on the scope of the phylogenetic study. When dealing \nwith not-too-distantly related species it may yield more or less useful result. However, in a study \ncovering many phyla it is very difficult, if not impossible, to collect a common set of conserved proteins. Moreover, the concatenation method can never lead to very convincing conclusion, as give or take a few \nproteins may change the result. The phylogenomics people have noticed this problem, see, e.g., \nO. Jeffroy, H. Brinkman, F. Delsuc, H. Philippe (2008) Phylogenomics: the beginning of \nincongruence? Trends in Genetics, 22(4): 225\u2013231. \nAn example from the Bacteria domain is the relationship of the closely related Shigella and Escherichia \ncoli strains. Concatenation of different number of genes led to different way of mixing-up of the two \ngroups, but CVTree gave unambiguous separation of the strains as different species in the same genus \nEscherichia, see: \nG.-H. Zuo, Z. Xu, B.L. Hao (2013) Shigella strains are not clones of Escherichia coli but \nsister species in the genus Escherichia. Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics, 11: 61\u201365. \nIn order to carry out multi-alignment of concatenated sequences, a postdoc or well-trained PhD student \nequipped with the corresponding software is required. In contrast, with genome sequencing becoming a \ncommon practice in many labs it costs no additional work for a bench-microbiologist to get phylogenetic \nand taxonomic information by using a convenient and publically available tool such as the CVTree web \nserve. Well, we would be glad to see comparison of CVTree phylogeny with multi-alignment of \nconcatenated proteins if anyone finds a way to do it for so many diverse phyla, but we do not consider it \nas a doable job.",
      "Author.2.2": "These points were discussed in the \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d section added at the suggestion \nof Reviewer 2. The following was copied from the manuscript: \n\u201cTraditionally a newly generated phylogenetic tree is subject to statistical re-sampling tests \nsuch as bootstrap and jackknife. CVTree does not use sequence alignment. Consequently, there \nis no way to recognize informative or non-informative sites. Instead we take all the protein \nproducts encoded in a genome as a sampling pool for carrying out bootstrap or jackknife tests \n(citing our 2004 paper). Although it was very time-consuming, CVTrees did have well passed \nthese tests (citing our 2010 paper). However, successfully passing statistical re-sampling tests \nonly tells about the stability and self-consistency of the tree with respect to small variations of \nthe input data. It is by far not a proof of objective correctness of the tree. Direct comparison of \nall branchings in a tree with an independent taxonomy at all ranks would provide such a proof, \nThe 16S rRNA phylogeny cannot be verified by the Bergey's taxonomy, as the latter follows the \nformer. However, agreement of branchings in CVTree with the Bergey's taxonomy would \nprovide much stronger support to the tree as compared to statistical tests. This is the strategy we \nadopt for the CVTree approach.\u201d \n\u201cThere are two aspects of a phylogenetic tree: the branching order (topology) and the branch \nlengths. Branching order is related to classification and branch length to evolution time. \nCalibration of branch lengths is always associated with the assumption that mutation rate remains more or less a constant across all species represented in a tree, an assumption that \ncannot hold true in a large-scale phylogenetic study like the present one. Therefore, branching \norder in trees is of primary concern, whereas calibration of branch lengths makes less sense. \nAccordingly, all figures in this paper only show the branching scheme without indication of \nbranch lengths and bootstrap values\u201d.",
      "Author.2.3": "Yes, this is an apparent discrepancy of CVTree from 16S (and 23S) analysis for the given \nset of 179 archaeal genomes. However, in an on-going study of ours (not published yet) using a much \nlarger data set this violation no longer shows up; both Korarchaeota and Crenarchaeota restore their \nphylum status. Taking into account the fact that both Korarchaeota and Thermofilaceae are \nrepresented by single species for the time being, their placement certainly requires further study with \nbroader sampling of genomes.",
      "Author.2.4": "Highly degenerated genomes of many symbiont organisms tend to move around, in \nparticular, to the baseline of a tree and thus distorts the overall structure of the tree. Therefore, it is \nbetter not to mix them with free-living organisms in a study. We rephrased the corresponding \nparagraph in the manuscript: \n\u201cThe nanosized archaean symbiont Nanoarchaeum equitans has a highly reduced genome \n(490,885 bp). It is the only described representative of a newly proposed phylum Nanoarchaeota \nand it cuts into the otherwise monophyletic phylum Euryarchaeota. We note that the monophyly \nof Euryarchaeota was also violated by Nanoarchaeum in some 16S rRNA trees, see, e.g., Figure \n4 in a 2009 microbial survey as well as (c) and (d) in our Figure 3. It has been known that tiny \ngenomes of endosymbiont microbes often tend to move towards baseline of a tree and distort the \noverall picture. In fact, we have suggested skipping such tiny genomes when studying bacterial \nphylogeny, see, e.g., (citing our 2010 paper) and a note in the home page of the CVTree Web \nServer. In the present case we may at most say that Nanoarchaeota probably makes a separate \nphylum, but its cutting into Euryarchaeota might be a side effect due to the tiny size of the highly \nreduced genome\u201d.",
      "Author.2.5": "Yes, there was certain disturbing effect of the tiny and lonely Nanoarchaeum genome, yet \nthe Halobacteria is a very specific clade, forming a tightly connected group and moving around as a \nwhole, mainly due to the biased acidity of their constituent amino acids. We anticipate that the relative \nplacement of Halobacteria with respect to other groups may stabilize when more genomes are used to \nconstruct a tree.",
      "Author.2.6": "We have done a major revision of the manuscript. A new \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d section \nhas been added. Such issues as statistical resampling tests (bootstrap and jackknife), calibration of \nbranch length, the meaning and choice of the peptide length K, etc., were discussed in the new section. \nFigures 1 and 2 were combined to a new Figure 1; Figures 3 and 4 were combined to become a new \nFigure 2. Figure captions were made more detailed. The whole text was checked for language flaws \nand many places were rephrased.",

      "Author.2.8": "Yes, 16S rRNA phylogeny is quite stable and it almost defines the present taxonomy. \nWe have given due credit for this. In general, CVTree does not challenge 16S rRNA analysis but \ncomplement it.",
      "Author.2.9": "A robust phylogenetic tree comes with a fixed branching order of leaves. One looks at the \nleaf names and their taxonomic lineage and tries to map the latter to the branches. To this end we \nadded the following paragraphs in the \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d section. \n\u201cThere are two aspects of a phylogenetic tree: the branching order (topology) and the branch \nlengths. Branching order is related to classification and branch length to evolution time. \nCalibration of branch lengths is always associated with the assumption that mutation rate \nremains more or less a constant across all species represented in a tree, an assumption that \ncannot hold true in a large-scale phylogenetic study like the present one. Therefore, branching \norder in trees is of primary concern, whereas calibration of branch lengths makes less sense. \nAccordingly, all figures in this paper only show the branching scheme without indication of \nbranch lengths and bootstrap values.\u201d \n\u201cBranching order in a tree by itself does not bring about taxonomic ranks, e,g, class or order. \nThe latter can be assigned only after comparison with a reference taxonomy which is not a rigid \nframework but a modifiable system. Though a dissimilarity measure figures in the CVTree \nalgorithm, it is not realistic to delineate taxa by using this measure at least for the time being. \nEven if defined in the future, it must be lineage-dependent. For example, it cannot be expected \nthat the same degree of dissimilarity may be used to delineate classes in all phyla. In addition, \nmonophyly is a guiding principle in comparing branching order with taxonomy. Here monophyly \nmust be understood in a pragmatic way restricted to the given set of input data and the reference \ntaxonomy. If all genomes from a taxon appear exclusively in a tree branch, the branch is said to \nbe monophyletic.\u201d",
      "Author.2.10": "We have reorganized the manuscript mainly by adding a new \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d \nsection where discussions on branch length, statistical resampling, meaning and choice of K, etc., \nwere given.

The peptide length K looks like a parameter, but it is actually not a parameter. Using a \nlonger K emphasizes species-specificity, while a shorter K takes into account more common features \nwith neighboring species. However, we never adjust K: a fixed K is used for all genomes to construct a \ntree, but one may construct a series of trees for K = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \u2026 We have shown repeatedly that K = 5 and 6 lead to best results in the sense of agreement with taxonomy, so usually only a K = 6 tree \nis given in publications. \nLet us look at a subtree, i.e., part of a tree, containing the organisms of interest. If the branching \norder in all trees built for different Ks turns out to be same, it would be a strong support to the \nbranching order. In most cases the branching order varies with K: K = 3 and 4 make sense, K = 5 and \n6 yield the best, K = 7 and 8 become slightly worse, etc. For too big a K, even if the closest strains \nremain grouped together the whole tree may tend to become a star-tree, i.e., every small clade stands \nin its own and their mutual placements become less meaningful. Therefore, inspection of trees for a \nrange of K-values provides an additional dimension to evaluate the results. \nFor Aciduprofumdum we have a stable pair \n(<C>Thermococci{18}, <G>Aciduprofumdum{2}) at K=3, 5, 6, 7. \nAt K = 4 we have \n(<C>Thermococci{18}, (<G>Staphylothermus{2}, <G>Aciduprofundum{2})) \nIn all these cases Thermoplasmata stands farther away from the above pair. However, at K = 8 and \n9, when the overall tree picture has been largely distorted, Aciduliprofundum does stand closer to \nThermaplasmata. Putting together all the above results we tend to consider the pair \n(<C>Thermococci{18}, <G>Aciduliprofundum{2}) as reflecting a more probable relation. Confined \nto the available data for the time being one may assign <G>Aciduliprofundum to <C>Thermococci, \ne.g., to denote the pair as \n<C>Thermococci{20}=(<F>Thermococcaceae{18}, <G>Aciduliprofundum{2}) \nleaving its family unclassified or assign it to a new family. Without further phenotypic and \nchemotaxonomic evidence it is better not to introduce new taxon names if the present naming scheme \nis capable to accommodate the leaves without conflict. This was why we wrote \u201cthis modification \nwould hold as long as no new facts challenge it\u201d. Anyway, taxonomy has always been a work in \nprogress. One has to be prepared for modifications when new data appear. To make a long story \nshort, we have rewritten the paragraph as: \n\u201cThe Candidatus genus Aciduliprofundum is considered a member of the DHEV2 (deap-sea \nhydrothermal vent euryarchaeotic 2) phylogenetic cluster. No taxonomic information was given \nin the original papers [55,56]. The NCBI Taxonomy did not provide definite lineage information \nfor this taxon at the class, order, and family ranks. According to [55] the whole DHEV2 cluster \nwas located close to Thermoplamatales in a maximum-likelihood analysis of 16S rRNA \nsequences. A similar placement was seen in [54] where a Bayesian tree of the archaeal domain \nbased on concatenation of 57 ribosomal proteins put a lonely Aciduliprofundum next to \nThermoplasmata. However, in CVTrees, constructed for all K-values from 3 to 9, \nAciduliprofundum juxstaposes with the class Thermococci{18}. An observation in [56] that this \norganism shares a rare lipid structure with a few species from Thermococcales may hint on its \npossible association with the latter. If we temporarily presume a lineage \n<C>Thermococci<O>Unclassified<F>Unclassified<G>Aciduliprofundum\u2026one might have a monophyletic class <C>Thermococci{20}. Since none of the 13 DHEV2 \nmembers listed in [55] has a sequenced genome so far, CVTree cannot tell the placement of the \nDHEV2 cluster as a whole for the time being. It remains an open problem as whether DHEV2 is \nclose to Thermoplasmata or to Thermococci, or a new class is needed to accommodate DHEV2.\u201d",

      "Author.2.26": "We should first explain how these inappropriate names appeared. We have insisted to use \nthe directory name at the NCBI FTP site as genome name. However, in November 2013 NCBI \nannounced that they would not release genomes of different strains of the same species as before. In a \nperiod thereafter NCBI sometimes put several genomes in a directory and we had to extract the data \nand to assign a name from the \u201cSource\u201d line of the GenBank file. This caused some confusion. For \nexample, as of February 27, 2015, a directory name at NCBI remained \n\u201carchaeon_Mx1201_uid196597\u201d and we had to change it to: \nCandidatus_Methanomethylophilus_alvus_Mx1201_uid196597 \nNow all \u201cwrong names\u201d as pointed out by the Reviewer no longer appear in figures. In the text we \ntried to refer to their names as complete as possible.",
      "Author.2.27": "The genome name at NCBI FTP site is \u201chalophilic_archaeon_DL31_uid72619\u201d. The uid \nnumber was dropped when mentioned in the text. We put it back and capitalized the first letter to \n\u201cHalophilic\u201d, still an illegal genus name.",

      "Author.2.30": "One cannot tell the rank of a node/leaf in a tree by simply looking at it. A reference \ntaxonomy is alwys needed. We put the following in the \u201cMaterial and Method\u201d section to explain it: \n\u201cBranching order in a tree by itself does not bring about taxonomic ranks, e,g, class or order. \nThe latter can be assigned only after comparison with a reference taxonomy which is not a rigid \nframework but a modifiable system. Though a dissimilarity measure figures in the CVTree \nalgorithm, it is not realistic to delineate taxa by using this measure at least for the time being. \nEven if defined in the future, it must be lineage-dependent. For example, it cannot be expected \nthat the same degree of dissimilarity may be used to delineate classes in all phyla. In addition, \nmonophyly is a guiding principle in comparing branching order with taxonomy. Here monophyly \nmust be understood in a pragmatic way restricted to the given set of input data and the reference \ntaxonomy. If all genomes from a taxon appear exclusively in a tree branch, the branch is said to \nbe monophyletic.\u201d",

      "Author.2.32": "The whole paragraph has been rewritten as: \n\u201cThe nanosized archaean symbiont Nanoarchaeum equitans has a highly reduced genome \n(490,885 bp [44]). It is the only described representative of a newly proposed phylum \nNanoarchaeota and it cuts into the otherwise monophyletic phylum Euryarchaeota. We note that \nthe monophyly of Euryarchaeota was also violated by Nanoarchaeum in some 16S rRNA trees, \nsee, e.g., Figure 4 in a 2009 paper [61] as well as (c) and (d) in our Figure 4. It has been known \nthat tiny genomes of endosymbiont microbes often tend to move towards baseline of a tree and \ndistort the overall picture. In fact, we have suggested skipping such tiny genomes when studying \nbacterial phylogeny, see, e.g., [29] and a note in the home page of the CVTree Web Server [21]. \nIn the present case we may at most say that Nanoarchaeota probably makes a separate phylum, \nbut its cutting into Euryarchaeota might be a side effect due to the tiny size of the highly \nreduced genome.\u201d",
      "Author.2.33": "As a method CVTree is independent of 16S rRNA analysis. First, it uses protein products in \na genome instead of RNA segments in the genome. Second, it does not do sequence alignment. CVTree \ngenerates stable trees but cannot tell which branch corresponds to what taxon. Only after comparison \nwith the existing classification and nomenclature one would be able to make connections with \ntaxonomy. In this sense it does depend on 16S rRNA taxonomy. Anyway, CVTree does not challenge \n16S rRNA analysis but makes it more convincing in most cases. The revealed discrepancies call for \nfurther study.",
      "Author.2.34": "In fact, genomic approaches are more effective at species level and below due to their high \nresolution power. At high ranks CVTree may be more effective in the sense that it does not require \nadditional work.
