      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "Line 156 \u2013 the authors refer to \u201cad-hoc rules\u201d that they have developed for consideration of the different coding transcripts associated with the same spliceogenic variant in variant interpretation and classification. Although a reference is provided so that the reader can look up what these ad-hoc rules are, it would also be helpful to briefly describe these in the current manuscript.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "Lines 250-251 and 263-265\u2013 In these lines the authors discuss transcripts in which the encoded proteins lack some beta strands. The lack of these protein structures are used as evidence to support pathogenicity. It is not clear from the text how lack of these beta strands is predicted to impact protein function. Is there evidence from another source that these beta strands are critical to protein function and that their loss is deleterious (rather than resulting in normal or slightly reduced protein activity)?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Lines 259-274 \u2013 This paragraph refers to evidence used in the variant interpretation of three aberrant transcripts that kept the open reading-frame (\u0394(E2p3), \u0394(E5) and \u25bc(E8p3)). However, the corresponding tables that summarizes variant classification according to the ACMG/AMP-based criteria (Table 2), does not include these transcript isoform names. As such, in order to correlate the discussion in this paragraph with the information in table 2, the reader also needs to cross reference Table 1 or 3. Incorporation of the transcript isoform names in table 2 would assist the reader in correlating this discussion of transcript isoforms with the corresponding evidence used to classify each of the variants.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "Lines 342-359 \u2013 This paragraph discusses two RAD51C variants, c.404+3A>G and c.705+3A>G, for which mg-FL transcripts were detected in 26.3% and 21.3% or transcripts, respectively. The discussion of these variants in this section (and in other sections) does not address the significance of canonical transcripts in these cases. Leaky splice variants have been reported in various genes and sometimes can be associated with milder phenotypes (or no phenotypes), presumably because the canonical isoforms contribute to a \u201cphenotypic rescue\u201d. Is it known whether there is a threshold of RAD51C deficiency that is tolerated before associated cancer risks become increased?"

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "in the Introduction in the sentence 61-69 the authors do not mention anything about BRCA1 (they mention MLH1 though);",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "I would expect that as BRCA1 splice variants are deeply studied. In the Materials and Methods, the section 2.6 is not actually a section that described some methodology. It appears to be more appropriate as results and maybe some information could be in the introduction.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "The acronyms need to be explained. Not all readers are familiar with PTC (premature termination codon) and NMD (nonsense mediated decay); as some variants are found PTC-NMD, this needs to be explained better. I would also stress a little more that FL is almost undetectable."

      "Author.2.1": "Acknowledge this comment.\r\n We have sequenced the RT-PCR products of all variant assays (indicated in Materials and Methods, section 2.5. Minigene Splicing Assays). In fact, all the *.ab1 sequence and*.fsa fragment analysis files of RT-PCR products will be freely available at http://hdl.handle.net/10261/270934; https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/14662 upon manuscript acceptance (links indicated in the manuscript section \u201cData Availability Statement\u201d).\r\n Unfortunately, Sanger sequencing only allowed us to characterize the main transcripts, while the minor ones (<10% of the overall expression) are really difficult to characterize since gel band extraction does not work properly with these small amounts, or other methods (e.g. subcloning of RT-PCR products into a PCR-vector, or RNAseq of minigene outcomes) are laborious and not cost-effective.\r\n Anyway, we have also been using Fluorescent fragment analysis for transcript characterization in our previous studies (since Acedo et al, 2012). We have shown that this technique is highly sensitive, accurate and shows high resolution. For example, in Figure 1c, transcripts with minimal size differences (1-3 nt) are well-discriminated. So, for minor-rare transcripts is a good option (not perfect, we agree with the reviewer) to annotate them.\r\n - To clarify it, we have modified this part:\r\n Lines 132-134:\r\n \u201cRT-PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen (Madrid, Spain), which allowed the characterization of the main variant-induced transcripts. Minor transcripts were annotated according to fluorescent fragment electrophoresis size data (see below).\u201d",
      "Author.2.2": "Acknowledge this comment. In this section we have tried to describe the classification approach and the rules we have followed to classify the variants. Certainly, we agree with the referee as sometimes the method is mixed with some results. So, we have moved some sentences of the last paragraph of Materials and Methods to Results.\r\n \u201cThe PM3 evidence (in trans with a pathogenic variant in a recessive disorder) did not con-tribute to the final classification. Not surprisingly (FANCO is an extremely rare FA complementation group) [37], none of the tested variants has been identified in Fanconi Anemia patients (ClinVar and Global Variome shared LOVD databases and literature search-es). Similarly, the BS2 evidence (in trans with a pathogenic variant in a healthy individual) does not contribute to the final classification of our tested variants. Finally, we have considered that some pathogenic (PS2, PM1, PM6, PP2, PP4) and benign (BP1, BP3, BP5) codes are not applicable to the classification of RAD51C variants.\u201d",
      "Author.2.3": "We have included explanations of these acronyms in text and Table 1 and have modified the following sentence:\r\n \u201cOf the 19 characterized transcripts, 14 introduced premature termination codons (PTC; PTC transcripts), and of these, 10 are predicted to be degraded by the Nonsense-Mediated Decay pathway (NMD; PTC-NMD transcripts) that is considered convincing evidence of deleteriousness (Supplementary Table S3). \u201c\r\n - We have modified the sentence of the Fl-transcript:\r\n \u201cAll variants altered splicing, 18 of which produced no traces of the mgFL-transcript or almost undetectable levels (<2.4%, c.904G>A)\u2026\u201d",
      "Author.2.4": "Very important comment. As the reviewer indicates, it would be essential to define the threshold of RAD51C expression from which it keeps its tumor suppressor activity. Unfortunately, it is not known by now but this finding would provide critical information to determine the pathogenicity of leaky spliceogenic variants.\r\n - So, we have modified this paragraph to introduce this information:\r\n \u201cOnly two variants (c.404+3A>G and c.705+3A>G) displayed 26% and 21% of the mgFL-transcript, respectively. Unfortunately, it is not known the minimal amount of RAD51C expression to confer tumor suppressor haplosufficiency so, these splicing assays were not considered informative (PVS1_O_N/A).\u201d\r\n Note that leaky variants generate complex minigene read-outs (two or more transcripts), and are therefore classified accordingly (see methods).",
