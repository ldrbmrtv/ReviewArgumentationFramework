Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;It remains unclear how the quantum regime (with coherent spatial delocalization and interference of probability amplitudes of different paths) could possibly be reached in a real experiment, as spontaneous scattering of photons (of the cavity light or of the side pumper) into free space would localize the atomic wavefuction into one lattice site and thus decohere any spatial delocalization.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;For a quick orientation it would be helpful to indicate the x-axis in Fig.1 and an (angular) frequency axis in Fig.2.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;"In Section I the authors write: ""The mechanism is similar to the ones exploited in the creation of artificial potentials in optical lattices [17]"". This statement is a bit misleading since [17] uses coherent (quantum-mechanical) tunnelling with complex tunnel amplitudes, whereas the present manuscript deals with classical trajectories and classical jump probabilities."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;This is similar to previous works on implementation of the quantum random walk with photons [18], atoms in optical lattices [19], ions in traps [20] or on a one-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits [21]: This statement is also misleading, because the cited references have reached the coherent quantum walk regime, while the present manuscript only hypothesizes about an (unspecified) possibility to enter the quantum regime.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;5;0;In Section II it should be clearly stated that this is a one-dimensional model, transverse forces or motion are not considered.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;6;0;"In Fig. 2: ""such that c < 0 corresponding to the stable regime of cavity QED with moving atoms"": what does this mean? The regime of cavity cooling?"
Reviewer_1;Author;1;7;0;In Section III the numerical value of \kappa is not given (only in the caption of Fig. 3 it is mentioned that \kappa is set to unity).
Reviewer_1;Author;1;8;0;The numerical values of the parameters used for the simulation are in the bad cavity regime (g << \kappa, \gamma). Does the special spatio-temporal shape of the potential, which is shown in Fig. 3, and which enables the effective random walk motion, originate in genuine cavity quantum effects, or could a similar potential be generated also in the classical (bad cavity) limit (g -> 0, \eta_L -> infinity and \kappa large), or for a classical standing wave laser beam interfering with a classical transverse running wave?
Reviewer_1;Author;1;9;0;In describing the action of the optical potential as quasi-random potential kicks, is there some long-term heating effect (i.e. an increase of the average energy of the atom)? Does cavity cooling play a role to counteract this in the numerical simulations?Response
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;In the paragraph following Eq. (2), please check the commutation relations between the raising (sigma^+) and lowering (sigma^-) operators and the Pauli matrix sigma^z. I suspect it should be [sigma^+,sigma^z] = - 2 sigma^+ and [sigma^-,sigma^z] = + 2 sigma^- .
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;"A couple of lines below Eq. (4), the Authors write ""We proceed in a standard way to derive equations of motion for classical quantities."" I would suggest to provide a reference to guide the less experienced reader."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;In the equations of motion for the atoms [Eqs. (6) and (7)] it is introduced the quantity gamma, which, I guess, is the atomic decay rate. Please, provide a definition of gamma. What is, if any, the role of gamma (spontaneous atomic decay rate) in the physical process under consideration? In the analytical results, derived in the adiabatic limit, gamma is eliminated and does not play any role. I wonder if one can draw any conclusion from the numerical simulations, where other regimes could have been explored.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;"At the end of Section IV C. ""Optical forces"" the time independent value of the force is derived. Please, check this value. I'm afraid there is a factor k missing (simple dimensional analysis shows that something is wrong with it)."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;5;0;The same argument (dimensional analysis) applies to Eqs. (24), (25) and (27). Please check again these expressions.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;6;0;"In section VI E. ""Trapping by longitudinal pumping"", one can analytically estimate the threshold value for the transverse pumping. How does this analytical result compare with the numerical simulations?"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;7;0;Please, be consistent with the choice of subscripts and superscripts: in the first column of page 2 the Pauli operator is denoted as sigma^z (superscript), whereas in the second column becomes sigma_z (subscript).
Reviewer_2;Author;1;8;0;Figure 4 is mentioned in the main text AFTER Fig. 5. It would be more logical to exchange their presentation order and, consequently, the figures numbering. Indeed, the same Authors already refer to the single trajectory plot as Fig. 4 (c) [see paragraph below Eq. (13)].
Reviewer_2;Author;1;9;0;Page 4, first paragraph, the particle initial conditions are chosen in the interval [ - 0.1, 0.1] (in the text a comma is missing).
Reviewer_2;Author;1;10;0;"Page 5, first column, second paragraph ""... one can inspect Eq. (11) b) where the right-hand side ..."". Please, eliminate ""b)"" since it is simply Eq. (11). The same misprint appears at page 8 in the paragraph between Eqs. (32) and (33)."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;11;0;"Page 6, ""Optical forces"": there is a missing subscript L in the first force term at the end of the first paragraph, just before Eq. (21)."

Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;We agree with the referee that in any open system as we have here , information will leak out and a corresponding backaction on the wavefunction cannot be avoided. However, by operating with ultra-cold quantum particles far of any internal resonance, the coherence time can be pretty long. This was shown with BEC’S trapped in cavities (see e.g. Ref 9). The effect of localization via cavity transmission can be reduced by working at higher cavity photon numbers. Ultimately the interplay between measurement induced localization and coherence spreading by unitary evolution could be one of the most interesting points in setting up such an experiment. One should study a transition from classical to quantum behavior depending on the degree of observation of the system.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;Axes added.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;We have reformulated to avoid confusion and unsubstantiated claims: “The mechanism is reminiscent of the one exploited in the creation of artificial potentials in optical lattices~\cite{Struck2012Tunable} applied here to the classical regime”
Author;Reviewer_1;2;4;4;We have rephrased: “In this sense, this work is a stepping stones towards a proposal for implementing a quantum random walk mirroring progress already achieved with photons…”.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;5;5;We have added a clarifying statement in the beginning of section 2: “We consider an effective one-dimensional model”.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;6;6;"The referee is correct; in the convention that we specify the negative detuning corresponds to the regime where motional instabilities are avoided and cavity cooling is possible. We included this in the figure caption."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;7;7;As we specify now in the beginning of section 3: “We treat $\eta_T$ as a free varying parameter. In the following we set $\kappa=1$ for numerical simulations and normalize the time in units of $\kappa^{-1}$”.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;8;8;As the referee correctly infers the random walk is merely an effect of the time modulation of the potential. The classical limit without time delayed action (characteristic of the cavity) will reproduce the kind of walk obtained in the LT limit where Fig. 3 and the analysis has been performed. The other regime where the transverse field kicks the particle out of the longitudinal trap is a cavity effect as the effective force (transverse) has a different modulation than the simple cosine of the free space transverse wave. However, for fine tuning of parameters and to insure stability of trajectories we have used the cavity cooling effect.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;9;9;Yes, some momentum diffusion can be expected. In principle using a sufficiently narrow cavity and suitable operation parameters cavity cooling could be tuned to cancel such unwanted heating. However, this is connected to dissipative dynamics and will change the effective operating parameters of the system. In the bad cavity limited on the other hand, one can expect some “cavity heating” instead of cooling, but the rate of this heating should be slow enough to allow for many kicks before it gets relevant.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;10;1;We have corrected the sign in the commutation relation.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;11;2;We have added a proper reference as Ref. [23].
Author;Reviewer_2;2;12;3;"We have added the definition for \gamma in the text. Here we focus on a dispersive regime of weak atomic excitation, where the so called dipole force dominates the mechanical atom field interaction and spontaneous emission plays a negligible role. In this limit the mechanical forces can be derived from a deterministic (time dependent) optical potential (see refs. 7-9 for details).
 However, as the referee points out, in the nonlinear dynamical regime, the effects stemming from the inclusion of a random spontaneous emission could be amplified. A similar randomness is connected to cavity cooling in a regime of weak coherent intra-cavity fields. This certainly will have to be considered in a quantum treatment.
 In our simulation we got the “quasi random” dynamics from deterministic motion connected to details of the initial conditions without including random forces."
Author;Reviewer_2;2;13;4;Indeed all the above mentioned expressions were missing a factor of \kappa as the referee correctly observed.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;14;6;The analytical considerations fit very well with numerical results. Indeed, in this regime, we have performed the simulations by choosing parameters derived from analytical considerations. The emergence of the jump regime is directly connected with the increase of the LT force to the value of the longitudinally-induced force but the fine tuning of the parameters is a bit tricky in order to insure that only jumps to neighbouring sites occur. Therefore we have restricted our presentation to the other regime where the jumps are strictly occurring owing to the transverse-longitudinal time modulation of the potential.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;15;7;We have fixed this mistake.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;16;8;We changed the order of the figures and corrected the reference to the wrong figure.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;17;9;Comma has been introduced.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;18;10;The b) has been eliminated.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;19;11;Subscript has been introduced.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;20;12;We have restricted the analysis to 2 curves (full and dashed) and a thinner red dashed curve corresponding to the analytical solution in the lower plots. The visibility is clearly increased and the message stays the same.
