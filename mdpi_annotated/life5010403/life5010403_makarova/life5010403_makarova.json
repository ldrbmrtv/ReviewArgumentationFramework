      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The data are interesting \r\nand worth publishing but\u2026\u2028\u2028\r\n(1) I don\u2019t understand how they calculated the protein molar ratios. In the methodology section we \r\nlearn that they extracted the crude proteins and then performed western analyses using specific \r\nantibodies, followed by image analyses. I don\u2019t understand how they converted the western data to \r\nread the amount of specific proteins, in fmol, in the various organisms as shown in Figure 2; and \r\nused for the calculations in the rest of the paper. (Why are the units provided again in Line 220?). \r\nPlease provide the reader with the methodology used for the quantification.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "PSII activity is derived from fluorescence measurement, as ETR. I am missing calibration with real \r\nmeasurements of PSII activity such as O2 evolution. You have got to show it for each organism you are examining otherwise it is worthless. There are many reports in the literature showing dramatic \r\ndecline in fluorescence but hardly any change in O2 evolution.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The cells were grown under a relatively low light intensity and thus the data presented here only \r\napply to these conditions. Please make sure the reader is aware of it."

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "Line 19 \u2013 I am not sure why stating the cyanobacteria are nondiazatrophic is relevant?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Line 46 \u2013 (and throughout) be clear if you mean numerically dominate or dominate production \u2013 \r\nthey are not always the same thing.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Introduction paragraph 2 \u2013 I am unsure we know that physbobilisomes require more resource than \r\npcb proteins \u2013 this depends on the ratio of antenna to reaction centre? Please include references if this has been shown. Also, not all Pcb proteins are constitutively expressed (e.g., see Bibby et al.\r\nNature 2003).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Line 250 \u2013 This is estimated number of RUBISCO active sites \u2013 or is there evidence all the \r\nRUBSCIO you quantify is active?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Figure 4 \u2013 The crunch of this paper is Figure 4e which show the Rubisco:PSII ratio is correlated to \r\nETR. While I\u2019m convinced in the presented data only three data-points are shown \u2013 I\u2019m most \r\nconvinced in that this same relationship is presented in in \u201cAquatic Photosynthesis (edition 2) \r\nFigure 7.9 \u2013 Falkowski\u201d based on work of Sukenik (1986?). A greater discussion should be given in \r\nthe text to how these datasets compare and what is significantly new in this dataset? References 35 \r\nand 36 are discussed in relation to the potential control of cytb6f on limiting electron transfer from \r\nPSII but more should be made of Falkowski\u2019s observations which support this data.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "Line 308 \u2013 The data presented is used to support potential cyclic electron flow around PSI \u2013 \r\nhowever other alternative terminal electron sinks could also be up-regulated \u2013 these concepts are \r\ndiscussed in a recent review by Milligan and Behrenfeld annual review 2013 \u2013 the implications of \r\nthis should be discussed unless the authors can show specifically enhanced flow around PSI.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "\u201cIn line 178 onward we read about the calibration curve. Please presnt it in the paper. Once you apply \r\nstress such as iron starvation you should recalibrate.\u201d",
      "Reviewer_2.3.2": "\u201cPlease present the calibration curves for the protein levels.\u201d"

      "Author.2.1": "This immunoquantitation method used is described in detail in the reference given \r\n(Brown et al. 2008). The reviewer is directed in particular to the Supplementary Methods section. To \r\nallow readers to get a better understanding of the method in this manuscript we have revised this part of \r\nthe Experimental Section, adding extra text to increase clarity concerning the method.",
      "Author.2.2": "Since submitting the manuscript, we have accumulated a set of 84 parallel measurements of \r\nsteady state oxygen evolution and the functional content of PSII measured using flash yields (with a solid \r\nstate optode) and simultaneous FRR chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves, from which we can \r\nextract e- PSII-1 s-1, for both Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cultures. \r\nConsistent with the long literature history of such measurements (ex. Suggett et al. 2004, 2009), we \r\nobserve a good correlation between the two measures of electron transport per PSII. Plotting the FRR \r\nestimate of e- PSII-1 s-1 versus the O2 evolution/PSII content estimate of e- PSII-1 s-1 gives a slope of \r\n1.26 and an R2 of 0.58. We have added this information to the Materials and Methods to support our use \r\nof FRR estimates of electron transport per PSII. \r\nFurthermore, our estimates of ETRmax from FRR induction curves are independently validated by the \r\nclose correlation between ETRmax and 1/tau, shown in Figure 4A, since 1/tau is derived from the rate \r\nconstant for the decay of fluorescence after induction, and thus does not depend (computationally) upon \r\nour estimator for ETRmax.",
      "Author.2.3": "This has been addressed with the addition of text in the abstract, introduction and discussion \r\nspecifying that the cultures were grown under low light conditions.",
      "Author.2.4": "We have removed the word \u201cnondiazotrophic\u201d as we agree that it is not relevant to the discussion.",
      "Author.2.5": "We mean that they numerically dominate and we have clarified this in the introduction.",
      "Author.2.6": "We have clarified this statement in the text. We refer to the nitrogen cost in the form of allocation to protein per pigment bound.",
      "Author.2.7": "We are referring to the number of RUBISCO active sites measured by immunoquantitation. \r\nWe are not referring to measured RUBISCO activity. We use this expression to be clear that we are \r\nreferring to RbcL subunits rather than oligomeric RUBISCO. We have added a parenthetic phrase to \r\nmake this more clear.",
      "Author.2.8": "We thank the reviewer for drawing this study to our attention. We have added a paragraph to \r\nthe discussion to compare and contrast the Sukenik work with that presented here. The Sukenik data \r\nsupport a strong positive correlation between 1/tau and the RUBISCO to PSU ratio over a series of \r\ngrowth irradiances. While we also see a strong positive correlation between 1/tau and RUBISCO to PSII \r\nour results differ as the molar ratios of the components of the PSU differ significantly between the \r\nstrains analyzed in the current work. This allows us to pinpoint the relationship of PSII to RUBISCO \r\nrather than other subunits of the PSU as the determinant of electron transport rate.",
      "Author.2.9": "We have added text to the end of the discussion to address this comment and the relevant \r\nreference has been added. Thank you for this suggestion.",
      "Author.4.1": "We have added a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure #2) to show this calibrations \r\ncurve. As all experiments presented here were performed under iron replete conditions, no iron \r\nstarvation was performed.",
      "Author.4.2": "We have added a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure #1) that shows the method \r\napplied with a sample blot, calibration curve and data analysis. This work required dozens of blots, each \r\nwith its own standard curve, so it would not be practical to show all of the standard curves for each \r\ndetermination.",
