      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "(1) It should be somehow mentioned more clearly (maybe in the abstract) that the idea is not completely new but work presents a new and more intutive picture of the system dynamics.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "(2) It is very helpful to connect cavity output spectra and forces. To my knowledge this was first discussed in: Gangl, M., EPJD, 8(1), 29-40. This should be mentioned.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "(3) The authors claim there should be no backaction of the field on the oscillation frequencies. This is somehow in contradiction with the eigenfrequency calculations (see Fig.4)  in Horak, P.,Physical Review A, 61(3), 033609, 2000.  ",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Also the BEC will lead to an effective change of the cavity length and lattice constant, which should renormalize the wavelength and thus om_recoil.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "(4) the cavity is an open quantum system. This has two consequences: ",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "(a) any measurement of the output field will generate backaction onto the condensate (Mekhov, J.Phys. B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, 45(10), 102001). This will generate extra noise, but might also help as it reduces atom number uncertainty in the cavity. ",

      "Author.2.3": "Concerning the referee\u2019s other point, about the suitability of this system to measure weak forces, we first note that the use of Bloch oscillations without a cavity is proving to be an excellent way to measure gravity (e.g. the experiments by G.M. Tino\u2019s group).",
      "Author.2.4": "Concerning the referee\u2019s other point, about the suitability of this system to measure weak forces, we first note that the use of Bloch oscillations without a cavity is proving to be an excellent way to measure gravity (e.g. the experiments by G.M. Tino\u2019s group).",
      "Author.2.5": "Concerning the question of whether we have taken the effects of higher Bloch bands into effect, our numerical calculations do take this into account. The question of higher Bloch bands is a little subtle when it comes to our analytical calculation done in the Wannier-Stark picture. In the presence of the force, the true eigenstates of the system are no longer the Bloch states but the localized Wannier-Stark states. In the analytical calculation we restrict ourselves to just the ground band Wannier-Stark states. However, even with this approximation we find very good agreement between the numerical and analytical calculations. ",
      "Author.2.6": "Done. We have re-written the first part of the abstract as: \u201cIn this paper we give a new description, in terms of optomechanics, of previous work on the problem of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with the optical lattice inside a laser-pumped optical cavity and subject to a bias force such as gravity \\cite{Ven09,Ped09,Gol14}. An atomic wave packet in a tilted lattice undergoes Bloch oscillations; in a highfinesse optical cavity the backaction of the atoms on the light leads to a  time-dependent modulation of the intracavity lattice depth at the Bloch frequency which can in turn transport the atoms up or down the lattice.\u201d",
      "Author.2.7": "We have added the following sentences on p3 (and four new references, including the one to Gangl\u2019s work, in the bibliography): \u201cA number of experiments have already demonstrated how the light transmitted by a cavity can be used to track the motion of atoms trapped inside \\cite{Hood98,Hood00,Pinkse00}, and in particular, a theoretical analysis of the information stored in the frequency spectrum has been given in \\cite{Gangl00}, showing that atomic motion introduces sidebands either side of the pump frequency. In our case, Bloch oscillations at angular frequency $\\omega_{B}$ generates sidebands separated from the pump frequency by $\\pm \\omega_{B}$ (and harmonics thereof in the strong coupling regime).Because the Bloch frequency is proportional to the applied force $\\omega_{B}= F d/\\hbar$, where $d=\\lambda/2$ is thelattice period, a detection of the spectrum of the transmitted light gives $F$ directly.\u201d",
      "Author.2.8": "Actually, we do not claim that oscillation frequencies in general will be unaffected by the backaction. Rather, we claim that one particular frequency, the Bloch frequency, will be unaffected.",
      "Author.2.9": "Concerning the change in wavelength (and hence change in lattice constant) due to the refractive index of the gas, this effect is tiny. We consider it in section 6, on p17 and show that the correction to the refractive index is of order 10^-9 for our parameters. This is to be distinguished from the effective change in the cavity length which, due to the resonance effect, is substantial and is precisely what lies behind the amplitude modulation of the lattice.",
      "Author.2.10": "Yes we agree that there will be extra noise due to the open nature of the cavity, and we already refer to this on p3 of the Introduction: \u201cThe disadvantage of working in a cavity is that quantum measurement backaction, in the form of random fluctuations in the cavity field due to photons spontaneously leaking out of the cavity, heats up the cold atoms and limits the coherence time of the measurement \\cite{Ven13}.\u201d where the cited paper is one of ours [Prasanna Venkatesh, B.; O\u2019Dell, D. H. J.; Bloch oscillations of cold atoms in a cavity: Effects of quantum noise. Phys. Rev. A 2013, 88, 013848] where we directlycalculated the heating effect for Bloch oscillating atoms in a cavity within the Bogoliubov approximation.",
      "Author.2.11": "The coherence time for the many-particle Bloch oscillating state is in fact very hard to calculate (mainly because even the coherent part is time-dependent rather than stationary). It can, however, be estimated and so we have added in the following sentences on p3: \u201cIn addition, in Section 6 (paragraph 4, Pg 18) we have provided further details required to estimate the coherence time for the parameters used in the paper. We find thatcoherence times of up to a couple of seconds (many  thousands of Bloch oscillation periods) are possible",
