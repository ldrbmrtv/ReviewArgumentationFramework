      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "However, the authors need to compare their findings to other research evidence showing impaired EIH and/or descending inhibition in patients with FM - especially considering that their results did not support EIH in the controls.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The authors merely mention that the exercise stimulus may have been insufficient for the controls to show EIH without critically discussing what such a conclusion would mean (eg, FM patients have better EIH mechanisms than the controls).",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Also, the discussion section should be revised to acknowledge that many patients with FM would have been excluded from participation in this study due to major depression and medication consumption so there may be concerns about the generalizability of the sample, BUT the authors appropriately compared the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores of their sample to normative data and found no significant difference.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "In addition, the authors might want to consider and mention that their method of controlling \u201cphysiological noise\u201d might have influenced the results because cardiovascular reactions to exercise were, at one time, proposed to be a mechanism of EIH.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "P. 1, L. 40 \u2013 I don\u2019t see that the reference actually includes studies of activities of daily living so the authors should revise the sentence or add an appropriate reference.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "P. 2, L. 18 \u2013 A reference for the determination that a dosage of antidepressants was \u201chigh\u201d should be provided.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "P. 3, L. 2 \u2013 Each temperature was applied twice so I assume the averages were used, but the authors should clarify.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "P. 3, L. 15 \u2013 The time post-exercise before scanning was provided, but not the time post-quiet rest.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.9": "P. 6, L. 5 \u2013 \u201cElevations\u201d should be revised to \u201chigher\u201d so that readers do not erroneously believe that a pre-scan application of heat stimuli was administered.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.10": "P. 6, L. 12 - I am uncertain why the authors only report the effect sizes of group differences for the first run.s",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "The authors have adequately addressed my concerns. I just see a grammatical error on page 13 line 11 where the manuscript reads \"there were also a difference....\""
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "Changes in pain sensitivity after exercise versus rest were significantly correlated with changes in activity in DLPFC (exercise vs. rest). However, in the latter case the authors need to address the issue of multiple correlations.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Nine individuals in each group were included in neuroimaging analyses, this should be indicated in the abstract.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "In table 3 the subheading \"Peak X, Y, X\" needs correction.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Consider discussing the results in relation to previous studies on exercise and neuroimaging.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "The findings are novel and may be compared to previous studies of exercise and neuroimaging in fibromyalgia."

    "Author": {
      "Author.2.1": "These analyses were intended primarily for descriptive purposes. However, we recognize the need to control for multiple comparisons in order to reduce the risk of making Type I errors. Therefore, we created 3 families including 2 correlations each  (one for each of the significant regions) and performed a Bonferroni correction, making the critical alpha level for significance 0.025.\r\n\r\nThis has been clarified in the statistical analysis section.",
      "Author.2.2": "This change has been made.",
      "Author.2.3": "This correction has been made.",
      "Author.2.4": "We agree that this would add valuable information to the discussion section and have added the paragraph shown below discussing previous work using neuroimaging to understand the effects of exercise on the brain.",
      "Author.2.5": "A growing number of studies have begun to employ neuroimaging methods to better understand the impact of exercise on the brain both longitudinally and acutely. For example, Smith and colleagues [37] conducted fMRI scans pre and post an exercise training program in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and found that exercise improved neural efficiency during cognitive tasks post-intervention. Structural MRI has also been used to show the neuroprotective effects of regular exercise in older adults with respect to preservation of brain volume[38]. In contrast to using neuroimaging to track changes in the brain over time, neuroimaging during and immediately following exercise presents some unique challenges due to artifacts associated with movement and the physiological underpinnings of many neuroimaging methods (e.g. BOLD response). EEG has been used most extensively to explore the effects of exercise on cortical activity [39]. PET and fMRI have also been used, though to a much lesser extent. For example, Boecker and colleagues used PET to demonstrate the effects of a long-distance run on opioid release in the brain and Janse Van Rensberg and colleagues used fMRI to examine brain responses to nicotine craving following 10 minutes of moderate intensity cycling. Our study adds to this important body of literature by using fMRI to show that an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise improved brain mechanisms underlying pain modulation in patients with chronic pain and further highlights the potential benefits of utilizing neuroimaging technology to better understand the more immediate effects of exercise on the human brain.",
      "Author.2.6": "We agree. We consulted with each physician with respect to type and dosage of medication, including whether this was a low, moderate or high dose. We also double-checked each medication and dose with the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (60th-65th editions). We have added the following information to the methods section \u201cMedication information and dosage were supplied by the patient and their physician and dosage levels (low, moderate, high) were determined through both physician consultation and use of the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (65th edition). \u201c",
      "Author.2.7": "This addition has been made.",
      "Author.2.8": "This addition has been made.",
      "Author.2.9": "The suggested change has been made.",
      "Author.2.10": "Thank you for catching this omission. This was an oversight on our part and these effect sizes are now included on page 11.",
