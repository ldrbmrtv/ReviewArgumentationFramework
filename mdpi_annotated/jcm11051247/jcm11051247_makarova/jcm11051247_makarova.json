      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "This study has a design flaw.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The impact of Tocilizumab on radiological changes can not be adequately analyzed without a control group not receiving the drug.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The proposed timing of Tocilizumab administration based on oxygen flow rate is interesting but undoubtedly requires a more detailed statistical analysis to convince the readers.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "I disagree with the title of the paper, \"The impact of tocilizumab on radiological changes...\". Without the control group, this paper does not provide evidence that the radiological changes are indeed the result of TOC.\nTherefore I would suggest the authors to change the title of their paper. Something in line with \"Optimal timing of TOC administration\" would seem more appropriate."

    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "Materials and Methods\u30002.1. Study design and population\nIf there are mutations or differences in viral strains during the course of the study, should differences in response to TOC and timing of administration depending on the strain be considered?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Results\n86 cases are excluded from 187 cases, which is too many. What is the reason?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Results\nWhen comparing different oxygen delivery methods, isn't it more appropriate to compare FiO2 \nrather than oxygen flow rate?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Results\nThe median oxygen flow rate is shown to be 14 L/min, but FiO2 may vary depending on the method \nof oxygen delivery (nasal canulae, HNF, MV).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Results The oxygen flow rate of 13 L/min measured by ROC as a cutoff value for TOC administration should \nbe presented by FiO2.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "Comparative radiologic changes before and after TOC administration\nIn Table 2, about the change in CT findings in fatal and non-fatal patients before and after TOC administration, isn't it the same as the difference in imaging findings between patients who survive after severe illness and those who do not, regardless of TOC?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "Timing of TOC administration according to the oxygen flow rates\nAs mentioned above, the cutoff value is O2 13L/min, but the oxygen volume is difficult to interpret because FiO2 varies depending on the method of oxygen delivery.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "The authors adequately addressed my concerns."

      "Author.2.1": "Thank you for this suggestion. While it would have been interesting to explore this \nfurther, our study focuses on retrospectively assessing and comparing disease progression within \nsubgroups of patients receiving TOC. Patients not receiving TOC would have likely had a different \npresentation, progression and their follow-up would be slightly out of the scope of our observational \nretrospective study. When we compared patients who received TOC with the 86 severe patients who \ndid not receive TOC (excluded from this analysis), the TOC group was far more severe, so there is no \ncontrol group that could be matched. In addition, these patients did not have control CT scans.",
      "Author.2.2": "Thank you for this suggestion.

      "Author.2.3": "Following this suggestion, we have included in the analysis a calculation according to \nthe FiO2. This has a cut-off which correlates to the oxygen flow cut-off.",
      "Author.2.4": "This is an interesting point. While knowledge of variants is of great importance from an \nepidemiologic point of view as they have different transmission rates and can cause diseases of \ndifferent severity, the mechanism of the acute inflammatory response in severe infection seems to be \nsimilar regardless the strain. While we did not perform specific sequencing of the strain for every\npatient as this wouldn\u2019t have been feasible, patients were included before the Delta variant emerged \nand we expect most of them to have had the initial D614G and UK B.1.1.7. \nNonetheless, we have included a comment addressing this aspect in our limitations section to \nhighlight this area of uncertainty.",
      "Author.2.5": "We agree with the referee that the reasons for the exclusions were unclear and have \nrephrased accordingly. Addresed in text: \u201eAll those excluded were not administered TOC either \nbecause of contraindications or TOC supply gaps.\u201d",
      "Author.2.6": "We added the data using FiO2 ROC curve. The area under the curve for FiO2 ROC curve \nwas smaller than the area under the curve for oxygen flow. In addition, the cut-off value for FiO2 \ncorresponded to the cut-off for the oxygen flow rate, so the two groups in Table 3 would be similar. \nWe added this information also in Table 3.",
      "Author.2.7": "We analysed FiO2 (depending on the method of oxygen delivery - nasal canulae, HNF, \nMV), as you suggested and the cut-off value of FiO2 corresponded to the cut-off for the oxygen flow \nrate, so the two groups in Table 3 would be similar. We added this information also in Table 3.",
      "Author.2.8": "Addressed in text and in Table 3.",
      "Author.2.9": "Thank you for pointing this out, we have changed Table 1 accordingly and we \nremoved the imaging data, which as you mentioned, was the same as \u201cbefore TOC\u201d in Table 2.",
      "Author.2.10": "Addressed, see previous comments and answers.",
