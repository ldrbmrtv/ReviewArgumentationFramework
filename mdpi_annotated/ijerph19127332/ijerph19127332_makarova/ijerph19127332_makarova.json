      "Author.2.29": "Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the content we did not mention in this part, but the soil was not quartered, so there is no supplement. Now the modification is as follows: \u201cCollect dust indoors or outdoors by cleaning dust from areas such as tables and windowsills. And 20 g of soil and as much dust (5-20 g) as possible were collected during the sampling process.\u201d",
      "Author.2.30": "Thanks for your advice! In view of the imperfection of the method and the defects of expression, we have added and improved this part, and the modification is as follows: \u201cFeces samples and food samples were pre-treated in the same way. Dried samples (1 g) were digested to evaporate at low temperatures of 55\u00b0C on a heating plate with 3 mL concentrated nitric acid, 3 mL hydrogen fluoride, and 1 mL perchloric acid (HNO3\u2012HF\u2012HClO4). The digestion process is repeated until the sample becomes sticky. Crushed Evaporated samples were microwaved with 2 mL concentrated nitric acid and 3 mL hydrogen peroxide (HNO3\u2012H2O2). Digestion was performed at 120\u00b0C for 5 min, then 160\u00b0C for 5 min, and finally 180\u00b0C for 15 min. The digested product was diluted to 30 ml with ultrapure water and then stored at 4\u00b0C.

The conditions of microwave digestion are the same as mentioned above. Finally, the digest was analyzed by HR\u2012ICP\u2012MS.\r\nDried soil and dust samples (0.5 g) were digested as same as feces and food samples on a heating plate by HNO3\u2012HF\u2012HClO4.

The supernatant was analyzed for Al, Ba, Mn, Ti, and V by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP\u2012OES, Spectra Arcos SOP, German) which is a method for atomic emission spectroscopy analysis using a light source that generates plasma discharge through high-frequency inductive coupling and by ICP\u2012MS for Ce, Sc, and Y. In addition, dried soil samples from living spaces (0.5 g) were digested with the same pre-treated and analyzed by ICP\u2012MS for Pb, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd, and Zn. The standard curve of concentration was used to determine the sample concentration was established by heavy metal standard (all standards were from The Nonferrous Metals Society of China).\u201d",
