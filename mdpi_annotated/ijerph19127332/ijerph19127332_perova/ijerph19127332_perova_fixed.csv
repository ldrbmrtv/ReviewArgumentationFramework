Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;Thank you for your advice. At first, the soil heavy metal data has been added in the supporting information (Table S4 and S5). Besides, our study focuses on estimating the children’s SIRs of from e‒waste disassembly areas by collecting and analyzing selected tracer elements in matched samples of their consumed food, feces, and urine, as well as soil samples from their play areas. We have examined the tracer elements in the food. And when we calculated the SIR, we also used the parameter “Cfood” (equation 1) to analyze the food intake.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;In addition, children’s feces and urine belong to biological samples, which is sufficient to calculate the SIR. Application of more biotic samples that you suggested is useful for our study, however, it is hard to get other samples from children, such as blood and tissue.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;At last, we also added the heavy metals information in resident or park green areas: “In resident and park green areas, the highest concentration of heavy metals is Zn and the lowest is Cd. The concentrations of heavy metals in park green areas were slightly higher than that in residential area, which may attribute to the difference of soil environmental quality management and control policy between these areas. Integrated data from the resident and park green areas, the median concentrations (mg/kg) of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were 48.8, 63.9, 128, 413, 6.30, 0.513, and 115, respectively.”
Author;Reviewer_1;2;4;4;Thanks for your reminder. In our study, 66 children were taken part in our analysis. But we failed to get all children’s feces and urine sample every day. Thus, we collected sample number was less the involved 66 children.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;5;5;Thank you for your reminder. We have uniformed the units to “(mL/d)”
Author;Reviewer_1;2;6;6;Thank you for your correction. In the manuscript, the data is with outlier. However, we used the data without outlier to construct the figure. At present, the related content in manuscript has been revised to: “The SIR values based on the measured tracer element concentrations of food, feces, urine, soil and dust are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1. The median (minimum and maximum) of SIR values were ‒124.3 (‒278.0 to 228.2), ‒210.2 (‒490.1 to 273.8), 27.1 (0.4 to 106.0), ‒22532.8 (‒29443.8 to ‒6215.9), 23.9 (‒45.3 to 268.0), 175.3 (‒56.4 to 1040.7), 39.2 (‒36.4 to 284.0), and ‒263.2 (‒491.4 to 132.3) mg/d for Al, Ba, Ce, Mn, Sc, Ti, Y, and V.”
Author;Reviewer_1;2;7;7;Thank you for your correction. In the manuscript, the data is with outlier. However, we used the data without outlier to construct the figure.

Author;Reviewer_1;2;8;8;Thank you for your correction. We have reorganized the SM figures and the manuscript content. The modifications are as follows: “The frequency distribution histograms show few outliers, most being high values (Figure S3 (a) and Figure S4). Experimental factors such as measurement error, source error, and transit time misalignment, may lead to some of these outliers. Other outliers may be due to the behavior of certain children, such as pica behavior or spending unusually large amounts of time playing in grassland. The medians of the SIR values after removing the high values (see Figure S3(b) and Figure 1) were taken as the final SIR values for children living in the studied e‒waste dismantling site in South China.”
Author;Reviewer_1;2;9;9;Thank you for your correction. It has been changed to “The LRL is ‒112.4‒100.9 mg/d which is considered as the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the 2.5th percentile (P2.5), whereas the URL is 516.9‒730.2 mg/d, which is considered as the upper limit of the 90% CI of the 97.5th percentile (P97.5). However, since negative SIR values are physically meaningless, the RI of the SIR for children living in e‒waste dismantling sites is 0‒730.4 mg/d. In this study, 95th per-centile values (383.3 mg/g) would be as recommended value.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;10;10;Thank you for your correction. It has been changed to “The 95th HQ values based on SIR mean value decreased in the order of Pb > As > Cr > Cu > Ni > Zn > Cd and all of them were below 1.

Author;Reviewer_2;2;14;3;"Thanks for your suggestion, we have sorted out the method part again, and now the modification is as follows: “Feces samples and food samples were pretreated in the same way. Dried samples (1 g) were digested to evaporate at low temperatures of 55°C on a heating plate with 3 mL concentrated nitric acid, 3 mL hydrogen fluoride, and 1 mL perchloric acid (HNO3‒HF‒HClO4). The digestion process was repeated until the sample becomes sticky. Crushed Evaporated samples were microwaved with 2 mL concentrated nitric acid and 3 mL hydrogen peroxide (HNO3‒H2O2). Digestion was performed at 120°C for 5 min, then 160°C for 5 min, and finally 180°C for 15 min. The digested product was diluted to 30 ml with ultrapure water and then stored at 4°C. The supernatant was extracted and analyzed by High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (HR‒ICP‒MS, Nu Attom, England) to determine Mn, Al, Ba, Ti, Ce, V, Sc, and Y.
 Urine samples (15 mL) were placed in a digestion tube and digested by microwaving with 2 mL of H2O2 and 3 mL of concentrated HNO3. The conditions of microwave digestion are the same as mentioned above. Finally, the digest was analyzed by HR‒ICP‒MS.
 Dried soil and dust samples (0.5 g) were digested as same as feces and food samples on a heating plate by HNO3‒HF‒HClO4. And then samples were microwaved with HNO3‒H2O2. The supernatant was analyzed for Al, Ba, Mn, Ti, and V by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP‒OES, Spectra Arcos SOP, German) which is a method for atomic emission spectroscopy analysis using a light source that generates plasma discharge through high-frequency inductive coupling and by ICP‒MS for Ce, Sc, and Y. In addition, dried soil samples from living spaces (0.5 g) were digested with the same pre-treated and analyzed by ICP‒MS for Pb, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd, and Zn. The standard curve of concentration was used to determine the sample concentration was established by heavy metal standard (all standards were from The Nonferrous Metals Society of China).”"
