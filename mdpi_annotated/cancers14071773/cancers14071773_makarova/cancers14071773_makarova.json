      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "Based on the cell line RNA and protein data the expression level of MACC1 is highly variable rather than being present or not. Is there a similar variability present among the tissue samples? Please provide the distribution of the IRS scores of the patient cohort and explain how was IRS 5 chosen as cut off?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The authors argue that MACC1 expression did not significantly influenced cell proliferation in the two cell line models. However, cell proliferation was analyzed only in a 24-hour long period even though most cancer cells have a doubling time around 24 hours. In order to draw a conclusion about the proliferation effect a longer (48 or 72 hours) measurement is necessary.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The concentration used from selumetinib both for the cell line experiments (10 microM) and for the animal experiments (50mg/kg) are quite high. Please discuss how the applied concentrations are related to the clinicaly used dosage (75 mg administered orally twice https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02448290) and why not the more efficient MEK1 inhibitor trametinib was used for the experiments. It would be nice to know the selumetinib sensitivity of the two used cell lines.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "The authors\u00b4answer regarding the cut off is sufficient, please include this argument either in the methods section or as supplementary information.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.2": "The authors refer to a data \"Proliferation of FLO1 EV and FLO1 MACC1 over 72 h\", however I couldn\u00b4t find the figure either in the manuscript file or here in the answer."

      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "[2] Abstract says 266 patients were analyzed (line 36), while result says 360 patients were analyzed (line 249). Please fix this inconsistency.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "[3] Throughout the paper, 10^x wrongly displays as 10x (e.g. \"105\" instead of \"10^5\" in lines 152 and 170, \"106\" instead of \"10^6\" in line 217, \"X2\" instead of \"X^2\" in line 241, \"108\" instead of \"10^8\" in lines 353, 354, 365, 366, 367, 368, 370, 371).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "[4] In Figures 3G and 3H, please specify p-values for untreated vs selumetinib in FLO-1/EV and OE33/shMACC1 respectively. If the difference is statistically significant, please briefly explain/speculate why.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "[5] If possible, please use a higher resolution version of Figures 3F and 3I (the legends are blurry and hard to read in the current version).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "[6] In line 306/307, please explain/speculate briefly why the control clone had higher MACC1 expression than the wildtype.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "[7] In line 272/273: (i) please report median survival in each group (instead of mean survival), (ii) please specify Hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (in addition to p values), (iii) please report both overall survival result and disease-specific survival result (since you showed both in Figures).",

      "Reviewer_2.1.10": "[10] If the journal allows it, please break up the abstract into Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion. If the journal requires an unstructured abstract instead, please reorganize the current abstract so that the content flows uninterrupted (e.g. \"MACC1 is an independent negative prognostic marker in AGE/S patients.\" should be after \"Expression was correlated with survival and morphological characteristics.\" and before \"To analyze the role of MACC1 in vitro the cell lines FLO-1 and OE33 were lentivirally manipulated.\" and so on).",

      "Author.2.1": "We apologize for the inconvenience. Figure 4 can be found on page 14 in the submitted version. We inserted Figure 4 in the revised manuscript again to solve the technical issue.",
      "Author.2.2": "We address this question in the results part MACC1 expression: \u201c Due to the procedure of cutting and staining, some samples could not be used for the evaluation. Samples with insufficiently representative tumor tissue were also excluded from the evaluation. Cores with representative tumor material and evaluable staining were available in 266 of 360 samples (73.9%)\u2026\u201d.\r\nTo avoid misunderstandings, we corrected the abstract to: 266 Samples of 360 AGE/S patients were analyzed for MACC1 expression.",
      "Author.2.3": "We thank the reviewer for this correction. This formatting issue was corrected throughout the entire manuscript.",
      "Author.2.4": "We thank the reviewer for this valuable hint. As suggested, we included p-values in Figure 3G and 3H. In Figure 3G there is a significant increase in migration of cells without MACC1 expression. This is based on a sufficiently large N, that renders even small differences statistically significant. Further, this increase is rather small and is outperformed by the MACC1-mediated increase in migration and the reduction in the MACC1-mediated migration by selumetinib. The data show, that selumetinib does not reduce migration of the MACC1-negative FLO1 and that MACC1 induces migration in this cell line that can be inhibited by selumetinib.",
      "Author.2.5": "We thank the reviewer for this suggestion to improve the visual quality of the manuscript. The legends of 3F and I have been enlarged and the resolution of the figure has been increased.",
      "Author.2.6": "We thank the reviewer for this discussion. The empty vector control clone was transduced and selected afterwards. During the selection procedure it is possible that a subclone was generated that expresses slightly more (or less) of any mRNA and protein. It differs from the wildtype by handling (transduction, selection etc) and somewhat by age (cell divisions). Therefore, for all comparisons the empty vector clone was used, as this clone was generated in parallel to the MACC1 clone.",
      "Author.2.7": "We thank the reviewer for pointing this out: Survival reports were changed in median survival and the 95% confidence interval were included. Additionally, disease-specific survival results were reported.",
      "Author.2.8": "We thank the reviewer for pointing this out: OR with the confidence interval is now included.",
      "Author.2.9": "We thank the reviewer for pointing this out: all survival reports were changed in median survival and the 95% confidence interval were included.",
      "Author.2.10": "Thank you for this valuable comment. The journal requires an unstructured abstract. As suggested by the reviewer, we have therefore reorganized the abstract and improved the flow of reading:\r\nAbstract:\r\nEsophageal and Gastric Adenocarcinomas (AGE/S) are characterized by early metastasis and poor survival. MACC1 (Metastasis Associated in Colon Cancer 1) acts in colon cancer as a metastasis inducer, linked to reduced survival. This project illuminates the role and potential of inhibition of MACC1 in AGE/S.\r\n\r\nUsing 266 of 360 TMAs and survival data of AGE/S patients we confirm the value of MACC1 as an independent negative prognostic marker in AGE/S patients. MACC1 gene expression correlated with survival and morphological characteristics. In vitro analysis of lentivirally MACC1 manipulated subclones of FLO-1 and OE33 showed enhanced migration induced by MACC1 in both cell line models, which could be inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor selumetinib. In vivo, the efficacy of selumetinib on tumor growth and metastasis of MACC1-overexpressing FLO-1 cells xenografted intrasplenically in NOG mice was tested. Mice with high MACC1 expressing cells developed faster and larger distant metastases. Treatment with selumetinib led to a significant reduction of metastasis exclusively in the MACC1 positive xenografts.",
      "Author.4.1": "There were no more open questions in the second review.",
      "Author.4.2": "thank you for this comment: we added the proliferation analyses by MTT into the method \r\nsection page 5: Additionally, proliferation for FLO-1/EV and FLO-1/MACC1 was analyzed over 72 h by \r\nMTT. 4x103 cells were plated into 96-well-plates and were allowed to accommodate for 24 h. after 48 \r\nand 72 h formazan crystals were dissolved in 150 \u03bcl of DMSO and the absorption was measured at \r\n560 nm in the absorbance reader (Tecan infinite 200 PRO). Each cell proliferation experiment was \r\nperformed in triplicates.\r\nWe added the results of the MTT analyses into the results section page 11: The additional analysis of \r\nthe proliferation over 72 h showed no significant differences between FLO-1/EV (100% \u00b1 4.886) and \r\nFLO-1/MACC1 (112.3% \u00b1 12.24; p=0.113) (see supplement Figure S3). \r\nWe added the MTT plot as figure S2 into the supplement section",
