Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;Thank you for giving the opportunity to read such an interesting paper.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;"For a better and accurate model I recommend the authors to eliminate from the model the 
extreme value. For example in Fig 2. - workers values greater then 40, community greater than 58, 
environment 45, customers 46 (the bullets), in Fig 3 - values with global score greater than 130, in 
Fig. 5 also all the bullets. Then repeat all the statistical analysis."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;"In lines 391-395 I would prefer an Sk and Ku between -1 and 1. You have some values that 
are not included in this interval - maybe because of the outliers from the figures above that I 
recommend to exclude."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;Overall the information presented it makes sense to me.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;Excellent work. Very well structured, with a critical and current problem. Keep it on in your future researches.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;1;0;"The paper is interesting; however, it is not clear what the authors are trying to achieve with 
this study. The authors test a popular assessment tool using confirmatory factor analysis and finds 
that the model is weak. However, there is no in-depth discussion or recommendations that follow. In 
fact, the discussion needs to be grounded in previous research findings in regard to 
CSR/sustainability indices/assessment tools/initiatives. Unfortunately, I am really not sure what the 
point is here."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;2;0;"Further, the hypothesis does not seem to be written correctly. First, it should be stated prior 
to the methods section. Second, currently it is descriptive. In other words, it doesn't state what the 
authors are trying to test in this study."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;3;0;"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend publication unless major changes are made to the 
discussion section and possibly recommendations are added for future research and practice."
Reviewer_4;Author;1;1;0;"The paper is well structured and presented in a very meaningful manner. It definitely adds 
a value to the existed literature."
Reviewer_4;Author;1;2;0;"There are minor corrections to be considered. This includes: Line 169 page 4, studies [28] & [29] do not reference to any presented argument(s) unless the 
preceding para."
Reviewer_4;Author;1;3;0;The word of Table in all text should start with capital letter (e.g. Line 199, L. 223)
Reviewer_4;Author;1;4;0;Paragraph presented after Table 2 (page 7) is a repetitive content to what has been presented in the Table. It could be removed or move to footnote.
Reviewer_4;Author;1;5;0;It is better to show the P-values in Table 3 rather than (***) although a note is indicated in this regard.
Reviewer_4;Author;1;6;0;"Very good practical recommendations and criticism to the B Corp certification have been presented in the last para. of section (6). No any future research recommendations have been 
suggested by the respected authors."
Reviewer_4;Author;1;7;0;References list is well prepared.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;Thank you. We very much appreciate the contributions.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;"Thank you for your suggestion. An analysis of extreme values was carried out, using 
univariate and multivariate detection methods. The analysis resulted in the elimination of 34 
univariate extreme values and 2 multivariate extreme values. All statistical analysis was repeated 
considering a database of 520 companies."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"Thank you for your suggestion. We researched more literature on the subject and 
adopted a more moderate perspective for assessing normality (|Sk|>2-3, |Ku|>7-10 and 
|KuMult|>10). As you mention, with the elimination of the extreme values, the skewness and 
kurtosis values improved significantly, approaching the range -1 to 1."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;4;4;Thank you. 
Author;Reviewer_2;2;5;1;Thank you. We very much appreciate the comment.
Author;Reviewer_3;2;6;1;Thank you for the suggestions. The discussion section has been improved and future research recommendations have been added in the conclusions.
Author;Reviewer_3;2;7;2;"Thank you for the suggestion. The hypothesis was removed since, as mentioned, it doesn't state what we are trying to test in this study. Factor analysis involves the examination of 
interdependence relationship, so it shouldn’t be expressed as a hypothesis that establishes dependence relationships."
Author;Reviewer_3;2;8;3;Major changes have been made to the paper. We hope that this new version may deserve your recommendation for publication.
Author;Reviewer_4;2;9;1;Thank you. We very much appreciate the comment.
Author;Reviewer_4;2;10;2;The argument associated with studies [28] & [29] was added.
Author;Reviewer_4;2;11;3;The words Table and Figure have all been revised to start with a capital letter.
Author;Reviewer_4;2;12;4;Paragraph presented after Table 2 (page 7) has been moved to footnote.
Author;Reviewer_4;2;13;5;The (***) have been replaced by the p-values (<0.001) in Table - B Impact Assessment -Regression Weights (original model) (current Table 6).
Author;Reviewer_4;2;14;6;Future research recommendations have been added to the conclusions.
Author;Reviewer_4;2;15;7;Thank you.
Reviewer_5;Author;1;1;0;"Title: The title demands a review because there isn’t a connection between the first part and 
the second one. We understand what the authors intend to inform us after reading the paper. Even 
though this was clear to me, the title doesn’t show the real idea developed in the paper. The objective 
is a good guide for the title."
Reviewer_5;Author;1;2;0;"Abstract: The content is well organized, but the results need some to attract the reader. What 
is the main result of the B assessment with the confirmatory analysis? Besides, the contribution isn’t 
clear here."
Reviewer_5;Author;1;3;0;"Introduction: This section demands more attention because there are some empty spaces to 
fill. The authors should explain better what is B Impact Assessment. What is its contribution to the 
structure of a model using Confirmatory Analysis? For me, lines 39 and 40 show the aim of the paper, 
but the idea is different from the ones presented in the abstract (“The main objective is to understand 
the B Impact Assessment, verifying its added value in the sustainability process and socio-economic 
development of the business sector”). The sentence in the Introduction is more complete than the 
main objective in the Abstract. The ‘areas’ represent a broader goal than the main dimensions of 
sustainability (Triple Bottom Line)."
Reviewer_5;Author;1;4;0;"Literature review: The lines from 70 to 82 could be summarized, and cut and paste in the 
Introduction section. I suggest cutting the text from lines 90 to 103 because it’s quite an advertisement 
for the B Certificate. The content in this section is exclusively dedicated to the Certification and the 
Corporation which offers it, there isn’t any scientific information there. The section demands a 
literature review about the theme, as the relationship between the certificate with adding value, 
sustainability, and the ‘areas’ governance, workers, community, environment, and customers. What 
is the idea of the assessment of sustainability, in these areas? This discussion is the basis of the paper, 
related to the objective, and connected with Figure 1 presented in the next section, Method. Even though the areas are from B Lab, the authors should study and related them to sustainability and 
value creation. There isn’t a literature review in this work."
Reviewer_5;Author;1;5;0;"Method: In the Abstract, the objective added an economic dimension to the development, 
but in lines 180 and 181 the impact to be measured includes just environmental and social. It was not 
clear to me who is the author of Figure 1, the B Lab, or the authors of this paper? There isn’t a source 
below the Title of Figure 1, though after that seems that B Corporation is the owner of it. The source 
of data from all companies in the sample isn’t clear, is B Corporation (site) or authors contact all these 
companies and did the survey? I understood that the data is from the B Corporation website. I 
accessed the link available in line 191 and there was a message ‘404 page not found, but when I clicked 
on ‘What is B Corporation’, I found the ‘areas’ and the steps for a company that intends to assess its 
practices and be certified. The authors should develop more theory than describe a model which has 
already existed.
Table 2 and the paragraph after it is a repetition of Figure 1 and Table 1, could be cut. It’s clever to 
reduce the number of companies, though it isn’t clear who contacts the companies, the authors or 
Company B?
The hypothesis is interesting when they come from a discussion in the literature review to the field 
research to test a theory (models, methods, frameworks, etc). Suddenly, appears one in the Method 
section, in a paper with a limited presentation of a technical model/certificate from an existed 
company"
Reviewer_5;Author;1;6;0;"Results: The sentence from line 137 to line 138 isn’t clear when I saw Figure 6. The authors 
could use a standard for a plural of index word, ‘indices’ (345) or ‘indexes’ (362). In line 384 the 
authors should substitute ‘chapter’ for ‘section’. The authors presented and analyzed the 
variables/areas of certification with many models, it is interesting and is a basis for analysis in the 
next section."
Reviewer_5;Author;1;7;0;"Discussion: In the first sentence, what is the topic that the authors mentioned? What source 
provided that information? The analysis is interesting, but demands more comparisons and 
explanations for cuts and adds. For me, the answer to Hypothesis 1 isn’t clear. The authors should 
reflect the presence of that in the text. The Cronbach’s Alpha ‘selected’ just ‘environment’ area of the 
B Lab model. This is an interesting result, which could be more analyzed with other assessment 
models presented in the text, to say what the authors wrote at the end of the section."
Reviewer_5;Author;1;8;0;"Conclusion: I just see one objective, but in the first sentence the authors wrote ‘objectives’. 
Where are they? The suggestions are interesting, but demand more analysis in the previous section."
Author;Reviewer_5;2;16;1;Thank you for the suggestion. The title has been clarified in line with the main objective.
Author;Reviewer_5;2;17;2;Thank you for the suggestions. The results were improved and the paper's contribution was added.
Author;Reviewer_5;2;18;3;"Thank you for the suggestions. The introduction has been improved, including a better explaination of B Impact Assessment. The use of confirmatory factor analysis has been explained. 
The aim of the paper was revised in the abstract to be aligned with the one presented in the introduction."
Author;Reviewer_5;2;19;4;"Thank you for the suggestions. Lines 70 to 82 have been revised and included in the 
introduction. Lines 90 to 103 have been revised and decided to be kept in the literature review as they 
express arguments from important scientific research ( S. Poponi, A. Colantoni, S. R. S. Cividino, and 
E. M. Mosconi, “The Stakeholders’ perspective within the B corp certification for a circular approach,” 
Sustain., vol. 11, no. 6, pp. 1–15, 2019, doi: 10.3390/su11061584. / T. De Mendonca and Y. Zhou, “What 
does targeting ecological sustainability mean for company financial performance?,” Bus. Strateg.

Resources,” Societies, vol. 10, no. 3, p. 72, 2020, doi: 10.3390/soc10030072.).
The literature review was enhanced with scientific information in the fields of sustainability and 
certification, and, B Lab certification and sustainability."
Author;Reviewer_5;2;20;5;"Thank you for the suggestions. The economic dimension has been added in the former 
lines 180 and 181. We clarify that figure 1 is original and was created by the authors. Regarding the 
data, we confirm that it was taken from the official website, during the period between March and 
May 2021. The link provided (https://bcorporation.eu/directory) was the one used. In the meantime, 
the site has been changed and the directory of certified companies can be found in another link. Table 
2 has been eliminated. To avoid the repetition of information in Table 2 and the paragraph after, we 
followed the recommendations of another reviewer by placing the paragraph as a footnote. The 
reduction in the number of companies was based on the analysis of the database and information 
collected from B Lab that allowed us to see that there was a change in the measurement model used 
in B Corp certification during the period January 2017 and March 2021. Thus, to ensure the consistency of the database and the statistical analysis subsequently performed, we reduced the 
database to a recent period in which the same measurement model was used. Finally, the hypothesis 
was removed since, as suggested by another reviewer, it doesn't state what we are trying to test in 
this study. Factor analysis involves the examination of interdependence relationship, so it shouldn’t 
be expressed as a hypothesis that establishes dependence relationships."
Author;Reviewer_5;2;21;6;"Thank you for the suggestions. We have replaced the word ""indicator"" with ""aspect"" to 
eliminate possible confusion with the 5 indicators in the B Impact Assessment Model (Figure 6). The 
text has been completely revised and the word 'indices' has been used as the standard. The word 
‘chapter’ has been replaced by ‘section’. Finally, we are thankful for the good appreciation to the 
many models studied in our research."
Author;Reviewer_5;2;22;7;"Thank you for the suggestions. The topic is “B Corp certification”. The text has been 
revised and the source has been added (E. Diez-Busto, L. Sanchez-Ruiz, and A. Fernandez-Laviada, 
“The b corp movement: A systematic literature review,” Sustain., vol. 13, no. 5, pp. 1–17, 2021, doi: 
10.3390/su13052508.). Hypothesis 1 has been removed with the justification provided in response 5.
Information was added on Cronbach’s Alpha and its impact on the need for B Impact Assessment 
improvement."
Author;Reviewer_5;2;23;8;"Thank you for the suggestions. The word was changed to “objective”. The discussion 
section has been improved in line with the suggestions made in the conclusion."
