For example in Fig 2. - workers values greater then 40, community greater than 58, \nenvironment 45, customers 46 (the bullets), in Fig 3 - values with global score greater than 130, in \nFig. 5 also all the bullets. Then repeat all the statistical analysis.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "In lines 391-395 I would prefer an Sk and Ku between -1 and 1. You have some values that \nare not included in this interval - maybe because of the outliers from the figures above that I \nrecommend to exclude.",

      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "The paper is interesting; however, it is not clear what the authors are trying to achieve with \nthis study. The authors test a popular assessment tool using confirmatory factor analysis and finds \nthat the model is weak. However, there is no in-depth discussion or recommendations that follow. In \nfact, the discussion needs to be grounded in previous research findings in regard to \nCSR/sustainability indices/assessment tools/initiatives. Unfortunately, I am really not sure what the \npoint is here.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "Further, the hypothesis does not seem to be written correctly. First, it should be stated prior \nto the methods section. Second, currently it is descriptive. In other words, it doesn't state what the \nauthors are trying to test in this study.",

The analysis resulted in the elimination of 34 \nunivariate extreme values and 2 multivariate extreme values. All statistical analysis was repeated \nconsidering a database of 520 companies.",
      "Author.2.3": "Thank you for your suggestion. We researched more literature on the subject and \nadopted a more moderate perspective for assessing normality (|Sk|>2-3, |Ku|>7-10 and \n|KuMult|>10). As you mention, with the elimination of the extreme values, the skewness and \nkurtosis values improved significantly, approaching the range -1 to 1.",

The use of confirmatory factor analysis has been explained. \nThe aim of the paper was revised in the abstract to be aligned with the one presented in the introduction.",
      "Author.2.19": "Thank you for the suggestions. Lines 70 to 82 have been revised and included in the \nintroduction. Lines 90 to 103 have been revised and decided to be kept in the literature review as they \nexpress arguments from important scientific research ( S. Poponi, A. Colantoni, S. R. S. Cividino, and \nE.

      "Author.2.20": "Thank you for the suggestions. The economic dimension has been added in the former \nlines 180 and 181. We clarify that figure 1 is original and was created by the authors. Regarding the \ndata, we confirm that it was taken from the official website, during the period between March and \nMay 2021. The link provided (https://bcorporation.eu/directory) was the one used. In the meantime, \nthe site has been changed and the directory of certified companies can be found in another link. Table \n2 has been eliminated. To avoid the repetition of information in Table 2 and the paragraph after, we \nfollowed the recommendations of another reviewer by placing the paragraph as a footnote. The \nreduction in the number of companies was based on the analysis of the database and information \ncollected from B Lab that allowed us to see that there was a change in the measurement model used \nin B Corp certification during the period January 2017 and March 2021. Thus, to ensure the consistency of the database and the statistical analysis subsequently performed, we reduced the \ndatabase to a recent period in which the same measurement model was used. Finally, the hypothesis \nwas removed since, as suggested by another reviewer, it doesn't state what we are trying to test in \nthis study. Factor analysis involves the examination of interdependence relationship, so it shouldn\u2019t \nbe expressed as a hypothesis that establishes dependence relationships.",
      "Author.2.21": "Thank you for the suggestions. We have replaced the word \"indicator\" with \"aspect\" to \neliminate possible confusion with the 5 indicators in the B Impact Assessment Model (Figure 6). The \ntext has been completely revised and the word 'indices' has been used as the standard. The word \n\u2018chapter\u2019 has been replaced by \u2018section\u2019.

    "Reviewer_5": {
      "Reviewer_5.1.1": "Title: The title demands a review because there isn\u2019t a connection between the first part and \nthe second one. We understand what the authors intend to inform us after reading the paper. Even \nthough this was clear to me, the title doesn\u2019t show the real idea developed in the paper. The objective \nis a good guide for the title.",
      "Reviewer_5.1.2": "Abstract: The content is well organized, but the results need some to attract the reader. What \nis the main result of the B assessment with the confirmatory analysis? Besides, the contribution isn\u2019t \nclear here.",
      "Reviewer_5.1.3": "Introduction: This section demands more attention because there are some empty spaces to \nfill. The authors should explain better what is B Impact Assessment. What is its contribution to the \nstructure of a model using Confirmatory Analysis? For me, lines 39 and 40 show the aim of the paper, \nbut the idea is different from the ones presented in the abstract (\u201cThe main objective is to understand \nthe B Impact Assessment, verifying its added value in the sustainability process and socio-economic \ndevelopment of the business sector\u201d). The sentence in the Introduction is more complete than the \nmain objective in the Abstract. The \u2018areas\u2019 represent a broader goal than the main dimensions of \nsustainability (Triple Bottom Line).",
      "Reviewer_5.1.4": "Literature review: The lines from 70 to 82 could be summarized, and cut and paste in the \nIntroduction section. I suggest cutting the text from lines 90 to 103 because it\u2019s quite an advertisement \nfor the B Certificate. The content in this section is exclusively dedicated to the Certification and the \nCorporation which offers it, there isn\u2019t any scientific information there. The section demands a \nliterature review about the theme, as the relationship between the certificate with adding value, \nsustainability, and the \u2018areas\u2019 governance, workers, community, environment, and customers. What \nis the idea of the assessment of sustainability, in these areas? This discussion is the basis of the paper, \nrelated to the objective, and connected with Figure 1 presented in the next section, Method. Even though the areas are from B Lab, the authors should study and related them to sustainability and \nvalue creation. There isn\u2019t a literature review in this work.",
      "Reviewer_5.1.5": "Method: In the Abstract, the objective added an economic dimension to the development, \nbut in lines 180 and 181 the impact to be measured includes just environmental and social. It was not \nclear to me who is the author of Figure 1, the B Lab, or the authors of this paper? There isn\u2019t a source \nbelow the Title of Figure 1, though after that seems that B Corporation is the owner of it. The source \nof data from all companies in the sample isn\u2019t clear, is B Corporation (site) or authors contact all these \ncompanies and did the survey? I understood that the data is from the B Corporation website. I \naccessed the link available in line 191 and there was a message \u2018404 page not found, but when I clicked \non \u2018What is B Corporation\u2019, I found the \u2018areas\u2019 and the steps for a company that intends to assess its \npractices and be certified. The authors should develop more theory than describe a model which has \nalready existed.\nTable 2 and the paragraph after it is a repetition of Figure 1 and Table 1, could be cut. It\u2019s clever to \nreduce the number of companies, though it isn\u2019t clear who contacts the companies, the authors or \nCompany B?\nThe hypothesis is interesting when they come from a discussion in the literature review to the field \nresearch to test a theory (models, methods, frameworks, etc). Suddenly, appears one in the Method \nsection, in a paper with a limited presentation of a technical model/certificate from an existed \ncompany",
      "Reviewer_5.1.6": "Results: The sentence from line 137 to line 138 isn\u2019t clear when I saw Figure 6. The authors \ncould use a standard for a plural of index word, \u2018indices\u2019 (345) or \u2018indexes\u2019 (362). In line 384 the \nauthors should substitute \u2018chapter\u2019 for \u2018section\u2019. The authors presented and analyzed the \nvariables/areas of certification with many models, it is interesting and is a basis for analysis in the \nnext section.",
      "Reviewer_5.1.7": "Discussion: In the first sentence, what is the topic that the authors mentioned? What source \nprovided that information? The analysis is interesting, but demands more comparisons and \nexplanations for cuts and adds. For me, the answer to Hypothesis 1 isn\u2019t clear. The authors should \nreflect the presence of that in the text. The Cronbach\u2019s Alpha \u2018selected\u2019 just \u2018environment\u2019 area of the \nB Lab model. This is an interesting result, which could be more analyzed with other assessment \nmodels presented in the text, to say what the authors wrote at the end of the section.",
      "Reviewer_5.1.8": "Conclusion: I just see one objective, but in the first sentence the authors wrote \u2018objectives\u2019. \nWhere are they? The suggestions are interesting, but demand more analysis in the previous section.",
      "Reviewer_5.3.1": "Is the content succinctly described and contextualized with respect to previous and present \ntheoretical background and empirical research (if applicable) on the topic? Must be improved.",
      "Reviewer_5.3.2": "Are the research design, questions, hypotheses and methods clearly stated? Can be improved.",
      "Reviewer_5.3.3": "The text has some improvements, but there are some points that still demand more attention."
