      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "First is the omission of any items referring to experience/use of eCigarette/vaping.  Thus it is unclear if students may be nicotine addicting by alternative means to tobacco smoking. ",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "Second it a lack of analysis of second-hand smoke exposure.  Specifically, whether exposure increases risk of smoking.  Correlations do not confirm causality.  It is likely that students who smoke actively seek roommates who smoke, and students who do not smoke seek roommates who do not smoke.  Thus, exposure alone offers little information about the role of second-hand smoke and \"contagion.\"",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Finally, I found it disturbing that medical school faculty tolerate student smoking at all.  This is contrary to accepted public health policy internationally.  Healthcare providers who smoke provide a bad example to their patients - giving the impression that smoking is not dangerous.  The link between smoking and reduced life expectancy has been shown to be causal.  This result calls into question the university's curriculum addressing the very many diseases associated with tobacco smoking - most of which reduce life expectancy.  This is the opposite of health promotion one expects from all healthcare providers - especially physicians.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "Thank you for addressing all the comments. The manuscript was professionaly revised."

      "Author.2.1": "There was a question related to electronic devices (eCigarettes) but we missed to add this data. Only 0.5% of participants used eCigaretes or similar devices. We added this sentence in the section Results.",
      "Author.2.2": "It has been showed that higher exposure to secondhand smoking increased the risk of smoking. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that variables such as secondhand smoke at home, secondhand smoke at faculty, and secondhand smoke at public spaces can determine whether students smoke or not. It is also obvious that non-smokers avoid being in closed smoking places, but this was not subject of this study.",
      "Author.2.3": "Your commentis very logical. Cigarette smoking, sedentary life-style and obesity are the major public \r\nhealth concerns, particularly in the Balkan region. This was a reason that we have provided some\r\nadditional comments and recommendations for further actions at the very end of the Discussion section.",
      "Author.2.4": "The \u201cAim of the study\u201d has been changed completely.",
      "Author.2.5": "To reply on this comment and to provide readers with more precise data we made some changes in two sections. In the subsection \u201cSample size\u201d of the section \u201cMaterials and \r\nmethods\u201d we emphasized that \u201cstudents from 16 faculties of the University of Banja Luka were participants in our study\u201d.\r\nIn section \u201cResults\u201d we have added a new sentence that \u201cMajority of study participants were medical students (41.4%) and the rest were students from other faculties (58.6%).\u201d",
      "Author.2.6": "This has been already presented in Table 2. and explained by asterisks (**) belowthe table: \r\n* Students who smoked at least one day in 30 days prior to the survey.\r\n** Students who smoke every day and desired to smoke always or sometimes upon waking up, and where smoking time after waking up was within one day.If necessary the English version of the Questionnaire could be provided as Supplementary material.",
      "Author.2.7": "We have made some changes in the section \u201cResults\u201d to avoid data duplication.",
      "Author.2.8": "The number of subjects (N) has been added.",
      "Author.2.9": "The contents of Table 6 and Table 7 have been rearranged and comprised into one table which is now Table 6.",
      "Author.2.10": "In the last paragraph of the section \u201cDiscussion\u201d we have proposed some practical implications and recommendations for further actions.",
      "Author.2.11": "The section \u201cConclusion\u201d has been completely revised and rearranged according to the reviewer\u2019s comment.",
