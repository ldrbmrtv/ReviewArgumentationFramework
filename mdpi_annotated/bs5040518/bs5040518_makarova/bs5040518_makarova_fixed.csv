Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;"This is a well-written paper with a large sample of girls that replicates and extends important research 
on relational aggression. The focus on the functions (reactive and proactive) of relational aggression has 
significant implications for intervention with adolescent girls. I commend the authors for this timely and 
crucial study on factors that influence the development of aggression and antisocial behavior in girls, 
which is typically an understudied topic."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;There are two areas to address to strengthen the paper a bit more.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;"First, it is recommended that the 
authors provide more information about the selection of the cluster solution. That is, no information is 
available in the present manuscript about alternative cluster solutions from the analysis, for example, the 
extent to which BIC and the silhouette coefficient differed for other solutions and so forth. It would help 
the reader to have some information available as a way of arguing more strongly that the accepted 
solution (which does make theoretical and empirical sense) is the strongest grouping."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;"Second, the manuscript should be carefully edited as there are a fair number of grammatical and 
typographical errors, including lack of subject-verb agreement in places (e.g., using “were” and “was” 
in the same sentence, both referring to the same measure - CU traits), omitted words, and so forth."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;1;0;"Although the rationale for selecting each of the 9 factors that might be differentially related to 
reactive or proactive relational aggression is convincing, the overall picture is incomplete on at 
least two accounts."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;2;0;"First, some factors (i.e., CU traits) may be predictors whereas others (i.e., 
delinquency) may be correlates or consequences of relational aggression. If the authors are really 
interested in the processes that could feed into reactive or proactive relational aggression in 
females, they should have been more attentive to this issue."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;3;0;"Second, the authors do not mention 
why they implicitly selected an additive model (i.e., each factor makes a unique and independent 
contribution) instead of, for example, an interactional model (i.e., peer and parent factors 
potentiate the link between individual factors and subtypes of relational aggression)."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;4;0;"Given the severe limitations of their cross-sectional design, the authors 
need to revise their comments with respect to directionality and their use of causality terms 
throughout the manuscript."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;5;0;Some measures such as selfreports of peers’ delinquency are also flawed because of a possible projection bias.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;6;0;"A better strategy would have been to predict 
each type of aggression while controlling its overlap with the other type (i.e., include reactive 
aggression when predicting proactive aggression and vice-versa)."
Reviewer_3;Author;1;7;0;"Some findings are difficult to reconcile with the current literature; in addition, they are internally 
inconsistent. For example, how to explain that the combined group is not more delinquent than 
the reactively aggressive group although they report more CU traits and more delinquent peers, 
two known factors in regard to delinquent behaviors?"
Reviewer_3;Author;1;8;0;"There are a number of grammatical and lexical problems throughout the manuscript that need to 
be taken care of."
Reviewer_4;Author;1;1;0;"The first two sentences of the abstract throw quite a bit of information at the reader, particularly as in 
the third sentence, it does not appear that all types of aggression will be assessed in the manuscript, but 
other constructs are introduced (contextual factors). Then, when the authors state the objectives of the 
study (in next sentence) CU, delinquency and peer influence is introduced."
Reviewer_4;Author;1;2;0;"Could the authors simplify the abstract? Is there a cohesive narrative that could bind the different 
constructs together?"
Reviewer_4;Author;1;3;0;"As it is, this reviewer had difficulty following the variables as predictors/outcomes and the hypotheses 
that are driving the paper"
Reviewer_4;Author;1;4;0;"There are enough variables that I hard a hard time following the analyses. A tighter focus in the intro 
and matching of analyses to hypotheses may help here."

Author;Reviewer_3;2;8;1;"We agree this would be useful but it was not our aim to look at interactions. We also believe interactions 
such as suggested are better done in longitudinal studies where one can examine moderators."

Author;Reviewer_3;2;10;4;"We have attempted to be mindful of causal language and only use it where prior research indicates a 
direction."
Author;Reviewer_3;2;11;5;"We agree this is a major flaw and we thank the reviewer for pointing out projection bias. We now include 
this in the limitations in the discussion."
Author;Reviewer_3;2;12;6;"We agree with the reviewer that there is no easy answer to this problem. We now include a discussion 
of this in the introduction and cite Lynam and colleagues on this exact dilemma. In their paper, they 
discuss the Perils of Partialing (p.4, line 15), which is what you do when you control for the overlap. 
That is, one may be removing the reliable aspect of the self-report measures of aggression (when they 
are highly correlated) and remaining with residual error."
Author;Reviewer_3;2;13;7;"The reactive aggressive group did not differ from the combined group on peer delinquency. Thus, both 
were high on delinquency and peer delinquency. Also, we comment on the overlap between peer 
delinquency and self-report of delinquency in the results section (p.9, line 14)."
Author;Reviewer_3;2;14;8;We have carefully edited the paper.

assist with understanding our predictors and the broader factors they represent in this study."

Reviewer_4;Author;3;1;0;I think the paper is improved. But I do not feel that the authors responded in great detail to my comments.
