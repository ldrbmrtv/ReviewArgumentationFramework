      "Author.2.4": "The three left-handed participants exhibited rMT and aMt typical of young adults of their age (Right, n=16, mean rMT 42%, aMT, 32%, see below for Left). We did not perform bilateral testing, so we cannot comment on hemispheric differences in excitability. However, our own investigation on the matter showed that Left-handers had higher rMT on the right hemisphere and, in fact, those individuals exhibited comparable rMT on the left hemisphere to that of mixed and right-handed individuals ( See Figure 3 in Davidson & Tremblay 2013)\n Subject Left-handed rMT aMT\n KY13 56% 46%\n KY8 36% 34%\n KY19 54% 38%\n Davidson, T., and F.

      "Author.2.7": "Yes, there are some differences given the difference in pulse configuration and coil output, However, rMT and aMT with the two stimulators were highly correlated at the individual level (r2=0.55).",
      "Author.2.8": "We have revised the statistical analysis given the Reviewer\u2019s comment below. Thanks to the Reviewer, we found out that there was a duplicate value in the dataset for MEP amplitude (hence the issue with 20 subjects in Figure 3). The error has been corrected and the analysis redone. Note that the correction did not change the results or the conclusions. We now report for the ANOVA\u2019s the F value and the partial eta squared to indicate the size of the intervention.",
      "Author.2.9": "Indeed, it would be interesting. The size of the intervention for variations in MEP amplitude, as reflected in eta squared, is 0.19, which appears smaller than that reported by Chung et al. However, such an effect size could hardly be compared with the \u201cstandardized mean difference\u2019 computed by Chung et al. The SMD is based on the assumption that differences in standard deviations among studies reflect differences in measurement scales and not real differences in variability among study participants (which is the case here)..",

      "Author.2.11": "We agree it does seem arbitrary but this approach has been used by many other investigators (see Hinder et al or Perellon et al) to assess neuroplastic responses to rTMS. In this respect, the \u00b110% cutoff provides a reasonable criterion to classify responders given the variability of responses to rTMS interventions.\n Hinder, M. R., E. L. Goss, H. Fujiyama, A. J.

      "Author.2.13": "We have corrected the sentence to state that SICF is observed when two stimuli are given at or above threshold.",
      "Author.2.14": "We agree with the Reviewer that having a direct comparison with the 50 Hz protocol would have been \u2018ideal\u2019 but we have clearly stated the reasons as to why we did not perform such a comparison. First, our primary goal was to describe the effects of a modified 30 Hz iTBS protocol and not to test the relative efficacy of 30 vs 50 Hz bursts. Besides, as we have stated, there is already ample evidence of the effects of 50 Hz/5 Hz in the literature. Second, as we have explained in the limitations, our study was performed in the context of a worldwide pandemic. In this respect, we disagree with the reviewer. The pandemic has and continues to have a major impact on our research activities. Our lab is located in a geriatric hospital setting. For this reason, we had to follow very strict rules regarding who was coming on the premises and how long they would stay. We were allowed to recruit research participants only if they came for a short period and stayed in one room. A comparison between 30 and 50 Hz protocols would have meant having participants come twice (on different days), exposing them each time to risks for COVID. As for the benefits of the 30 Hz protocol, those are clearly stated in the discussion regarding the number of responders and the size of the facilitation.",
      "Author.2.15": "We have added a sentence to clarify that participants were screened for health conditions.",
      "Author.2.16": "We collected more MEPS at baseline to account that variations in excitability are often larger when participants received their first series of TMS pulses (even if they have received some stimuli before collecting data to experience the sensation). Thus, 20 MEPs were deemed adequate to get a reliable estimate of resting corticomotor excitability. Along with the same reasoning, we collected 15 MEPs post iTBS since participants were now more familiar with the sensation elicited by TMS pulse and saved time. As we have explained, we had constraints imposed on us by the local REB to limit the time participants were on-site. The fact that we use 130% rMT for the test intensity also reduced inter-trial variability to provide reliable estimates of corticospinal excitability.",

      "Author.4.4": "The coefficient of determination is for the regression analysis and indicates that Lat differences were significant predictors of MEP facilitation. However, as we explained in the text, when participants were sorted into two groups (early and late I-waves), the difference between the two was not significant according to the Mann-Whitney U test.",
      "Author.4.5": "Actually, we did, but it seems that the new figure legend with the correction was not properly inserted when the system reformated the document.",
