      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The authors look at the expression of IbTCP11/17 (targets of miR319) from lines 418-424. Here authors capture the early response to PEG compared to the drought response (water withdrawal) assessed earlier. To have a meaningful comparison, the authors need to show the expression level of these two genes in the drought assay (Lines 400-417). As the authors briefly mentioned, PEG stress is more severe than water withdrawal, so it will not give a solid verification provided there are two variables, inducer, and timing. In our experience, we observed completely different responses when we tried to compare PEG, air drying, and water withdrawal. This is essential given that no temporal expression baseline is established for IbTCP11/17 under water withdrawal stress and the presence of other regulatory mechanisms of IbTCP11/17.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "It is interesting to see that only MDA content increases in response to drought. The possible mechanism/reason should be included in the discussion.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The discussion needs to be further expanded. Esp. RNA-Seq results need to be further discussed.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "There should be a summary (concluding statement at the end). This manuscript ends very abruptly.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "Comments #1 (gene expression assay) and #3 (proper discussion on RNA-Seq data) aren't properly addressed."
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "Pg 1 line 45: the wording \"and so on\" is awkward and imprecise. Please rephrase and indicate what other processes are being referred to.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Pg 2 line 67: don't assume that everyone reading the manuscript are aware of miRNA roles in plant stress physiology.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Pg 3 Plasmid and sweet potato genetic transformation section: Include relevant protocols instead of just referring to another manuscript. Citing the original source is required but so are details needed to reproduce and evaluate the soundness of the manuscript. The same applies to other parts of the materials and methods:",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Pg 6 line 239: I don't understand the point being made here. \"sequester the normal expression\" is nonsensical. Please clarify and rephrase."

      "Author.2.1": "Thanks for your good suggestion and we have improved it.",
      "Author.2.2": "Thanks for your good suggestion and we have added the possible reason in the discussion.",
      "Author.2.3": "Thank you for your positive and constructive suggestions and we have improved it in our revised manuscript.",
      "Author.2.4": "Thanks for your good suggestions on this point. In our revised manuscript, we have made corresponding modifications to summary our work.",
      "Author.2.5": "Thanks for your good suggestion. We removed \u201cand so on\u201d in our revised manuscript.",
      "Author.2.6": "Thanks for your reminding. We modified \u201cAs we all know\u201d into \u201cMore and more research reveals that\u201d.",
      "Author.2.7": "It is really true as you mention that the details of methods is needed. But considering that this method is also expressed in thus way in our previous articles (Ren L, et al (2021) Genome-Wide Identification of TCP Transcription Factors Family in Sweet Potato Reveals Significant Roles of miR319-Targeted TCPs in Leaf Anatomical Morphology. Front. Plant Sci. 12: 686698. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2021.686698), we just cite the original source here",
      "Author.2.8": "Thanks for your question Target mimicry is a common method to study the function of miRNA. There is a non-coding protein gene IPS in Arabidopsis, and its transcription RNA can specifically bind to miRNA through sequence complementarity, but it forms incomplete complementary bubble structure at the cleavage site of miRNA, that is, miRNA cannot cleavage IPS RNA, thus inhibiting the degradation of miRNA to its target gene mRNA. IPS gene is equivalent to the target mimicry. (Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007)",
