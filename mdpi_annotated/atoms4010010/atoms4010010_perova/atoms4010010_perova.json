      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "the authors did not show further supports to their calculations, namely, by comparing the present calculations with experiments or other theoretical method (from other groups)",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "In earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], a fully relativistic distorted-wave Born approximation (rDWBA) has been developed to describe the relativistic ionization processes. The authors did not mention this method for discussions in the manuscript. The RPWBA method in the manuscript should be compared with the previous rDWBA theory. At least the authors should mention the differences of the two methods and how far the RPWBA can be compared to rDWBA?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Again in earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], there are existing experiments of triple differential cross sections for relativistic K-shell ionization of Ag, Au, and so on. The authors did not mention these experimental works in the manuscript. It would be nice if the RPWBA method in the manuscript can be compared with the experiments.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "The authors have not carefully proofread this manuscript. Evidences of this includes (i) some errors in English typing, e.g. line 27 and line 119: it should be \u2018plane wave \u2026\u2019 instead of \u2018plan wave \u2026\u2019. Line between 33 and 34: it should be \u2018The scattered positron and ejected electron \u2026\u2019 instead of \u2018The scattered electron and ejected positron \u2026\u2019. (ii) There are repeated Bibliography like ref. 11 and ref. 31.",

      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "Page 1:* Line 7: it is referenced to the recent theories given in [2] and [3] which are from years 1994 and 2002 respectively. Maybe the word \"recent\" is not adequate here.* Line 19: \"Coulomb system\" -> \"Coulomb systems\"",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "Page 2:* Line 36: \"describes the probability\": actually it is the flux ratio, and it could be divergent in some cases. I think one should be careful. Maybe the authors could use \"is related to the probability\" or something like that.* Line 40: \"positrons\" -> \"positron\"* Line 43: \"positrons\" -> \"positron\" and \"ground state\" -> \"the ground state\".",
      "Reviewer_3.1.3": "Page 3:* unnumbered equation between eqs. (1) and (2) for Vd: in the second term of the right hand side (rhs) the quantities between the vertical bars are vectors and the notation should be different from that of the first term of the rhs, which represent a modulus.* unnumbered equations between eqs. (6) and (7): there should be a connector between the two equations such as a comma or \"and\", the same for eqs. (7) to (8) and (9) to (11).",
      "Reviewer_3.1.4": "Page 4:* Line 80: \"of model\" -> \"of the model\"* Line 81: \"in first\" -> \"in the first\"* line 86: the gamma letter (the Lorentz factor) must be defined in the text.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.5": "Page 5:* Lines 103 and 104: Maybe the identification of the used approximation for the three TDCS could be as subscript.* The fact that as the incident energy increases, the TDCS decreases and shifts towards smaller ejection angles for positron impact is said twice between lines 108 and 115.",
