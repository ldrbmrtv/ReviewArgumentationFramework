      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The authors admit that, line 367, younger people were overrepresented, but to me, it was that older persons, especially over age 70, who were somehow missed in the survey sampling process.  The study offers little to say about long covid among the elderly.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The authors consider a number of factors associated with long COVID and psychological symptoms.  I would suggest another factor - frustration with not getting well."

    "Reviewer_3": {
      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "However, I see several issues with the ending of this paper. I liked the ideas and the methodological setting (i.e., online survey) of this study and I think the reported data have potential. However, what I disliked was the interpretation and discussion of the empirical results. Frankly speaking, the authors are overselling their results. I found two major issues in the discussion of this paper",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "The authors said in the statistic section that \u201cstatistical significance was set at p<0.05.\u201d (page 5, line 212). However, later they wrote \u201cThe descriptively higher proportion of females with long COVID bordered statistical significance (p=0.05)\u201d page 5, line 230) and \u201cHowever, the different proportions of men and women with long COVID (22% and 33%, respectively) bordered towards statistical significance [\u2026]\u201d (page 10, line 318). As a statistician, I felt very mad about this, because the results speak a different language, this is non-significant result. ",
      "Reviewer_3.1.3": "The authors wrote later in the conclusion section \u201c[\u2026] but a non-significant trend was found for the association between female gender and long COVID.\u201d (page 11, line 389). This is a \u201cno-go\u201d in scientific research, the interpretation of \u201ctrends\u201d resulted from non-significant results is strongly misleading. Honestly, there is no empirical evidence that there is an association between female gender and long COVID, there was no significant difference observed between men and women (p=0.05). That is the true story. Hence, I urge the authors not to mislead readers and to re-write these sections.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.4": "The next major issue targets the interpretation of interaction effects. The authors did three models with three different outcomes, namely psychological distress, fatigue, and perceived stress. Authors introduced an interaction effect long COVID x gender into the model in order to test their third hypothesis (\u201c(iii) whether gender moderated the associations between long 119 COVID status and the health outcomes\u201d, page 3, line 119). In the results section, only two (and not three!) interaction effects became significant (psychological distress: p<0.001, fatigue: p<0.05, and perceived stress: p=0.36, see Table 4, page 7, line 269). However, the authors wrote \u201cWhile participants with long COVID generally perceived more psychological distress, fatigue, and stress than those without long COVID, differences were larger for men than for women\u201d page 9, line 303), ",
      "Reviewer_3.1.5": "\u201c[\u2026] men\u2019s perception of poorer health when having long COVID appears to include higher levels of psychological distress, fatigue and perceived stress\u201d (page 11, line 363), ",
      "Reviewer_3.1.6": "\u201c[\u2026] and the negative effects of long COVID on the health outcomes were larger for men than for women\u201d (page 11, line 392), ",
      "Reviewer_3.1.7": "and finally \u201cThird, long COVID appears to have a stronger effect on men than on women\u201d (page 11, line 401). Again, the authors are overselling their results. All these statements are not true, only for two out of three outcomes, namely psychological distress and fatigue, but not for perceived stress (see also Figure 3). Hence, I strongly urge the authors to re-write these sentences so that readers are not misled.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.8": "Besides these two major issues, I detected some smaller errors and miss-spellings (note, this list in not complete). Hence, I have some comments/suggestions that I hope will help the authors to further develop this line of work",
      "Reviewer_3.1.9": "Chapter 2 Materials and Methods: Something strange happened to the alignment of heading \u201c2.2 Sample\u201d (page 3, line 128). Please fix this.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.10": "Table 1 (page 3, line 137): I detected an error in the third column (\u201cCOVID-19 infection\u201d). The total sample is reported here as 303. However, the single numbers do not sum up to 303 but rather to 310 (13+74+220+3=310). I know, there were 7 missing values within the 310. However, this table is still wrong, it must be 310 and not 303. Please fix this. The percentage of 87 long COVID (28.7%) then refers to 303 (87/303=28.7%). Hence, I urge the authors to re-calculate percentages in Table 1. Otherwise, this is misleading the readership.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.11": "Chapter 2.3 Measures: Sometimes the verbal scales are set in italic (e.g., \u201c0=better than ususal\u201d, page 4, line 173) and sometimes not (e.g., \u201c4=very often\u201d, page 5, line 187). Please use a consistent writing style throughout the whole manuscript.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.12": "Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5: The authors use a very inconsistent style of bold. For example, see Table 4 (page 7, line 269): Column Fatgigue, why is ES not printed in bold? Please use a consistent writing style.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.13": "Results (page 7, line 274): Sometimes fatigue (page 7, line 274) and sometimes with a capital F (Fatigue, page 7, line 283). Please use a consistent writing style throughout the whole manuscript.",
      "Reviewer_3.3.1": "Wrong column headings in tables: I detected that the authors replaced \u201cGHQ\u201d with \u201cpsychological distress\u201d in the text (also \u201cPSS\u201d replaced with \u201cperceived stress\u201d). This is correct. Psychological distress is the latent construct which is measured with the instrument GHQ. Unfortunately, the authors missed to replace GHQ by psychological distress in Table 4 (page 7, line 280) and Table 5 (page 7, line 297; see column headings: not \u201cGHQ\u201d, \u201cFatigue\u201d, and \u201cPerceived stress\u201d but rather \u201cPsychological distress\u201d, \u201cFatigue\u201d, and \u201cPerceived stress\u201d). Please correct the two tables.",
      "Reviewer_3.3.2": "Wrong use of abbreviations: The authors introduced the abbreviation \u201cGHQ-12\u201d for the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (see page 4, line 161), but wrote in the text only \"GHQ\" (e.g., page 5, line 207; page 6, line 256; page 7, line 274). Please replace every single \u201cGHQ\u201d in the text with the correct abbreviation \u201cGHQ-12\u201d. Please repeat this procedure for \u201cPSS-10\u201d (see page 4, line 185), i.e. replace \u201cPSS\u201d with \u201cPSS-10\u201d in the whole text."
