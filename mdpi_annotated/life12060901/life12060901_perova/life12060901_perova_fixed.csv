Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;The authors admit that, line 367, younger people were overrepresented, but to me, it was that older persons, especially over age 70, who were somehow missed in the survey sampling process. The study offers little to say about long covid among the elderly.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;The authors consider a number of factors associated with long COVID and psychological symptoms. I would suggest another factor - frustration with not getting well. Normally, you get sick, you get better (if you don't die). You get injured moderately and you get better with time. Long COVID breaks that pattern - you get sick and stay sick. Like being sick and tired of being sick and tired. Some uncommon illnesses may act that way, but COVID has become endemic and common. What is your common cold lasted for ten months? People would get really irritated and discouraged by such a situation.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;I accept the manuscript for its publication in this journal.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;1;0;The authors said in the statistic section that “statistical significance was set at p<0.05.” (page 5, line 212). However, later they wrote “The descriptively higher proportion of females with long COVID bordered statistical significance (p=0.05)” page 5, line 230) and “However, the different proportions of men and women with long COVID (22% and 33%, respectively) bordered towards statistical significance […]” (page 10, line 318). As a statistician, I felt very mad about this, because the results speak a different language, this is non-significant result.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;2;0;The authors wrote later in the conclusion section “[…] but a non-significant trend was found for the association between female gender and long COVID.” (page 11, line 389). This is a “no-go” in scientific research, the interpretation of “trends” resulted from non-significant results is strongly misleading. Honestly, there is no empirical evidence that there is an association between female gender and long COVID, there was no significant difference observed between men and women (p=0.05). That is the true story. Hence, I urge the authors not to mislead readers and to re-write these sections.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;3;0;The next major issue targets the interpretation of interaction effects. The authors did three models with three different outcomes, namely psychological distress, fatigue, and perceived stress. Authors introduced an interaction effect long COVID x gender into the model in order to test their third hypothesis (“(iii) whether gender moderated the associations between long COVID status and the health outcomes”, page 3, line 119). In the results section, only two (and not three!) interaction effects became significant (psychological distress: p<0.001, fatigue: p<0.05, and perceived stress: p=0.36, see Table 4, page 7, line 269). However, the authors wrote “While participants with long COVID generally perceived more psychological distress, fatigue, and stress than those without long COVID, differences were larger for men than for women” page 9, line 303),
Reviewer_3;Author;1;4;0;“[…] men’s perception of poorer health when having long COVID appears to include higher levels of psychological distress, fatigue and perceived stress” (page 11, line 363),
Reviewer_3;Author;1;5;0;“[…] and the negative effects of long COVID on the health outcomes were larger for men than for women” (page 11, line 392)
Reviewer_3;Author;1;6;0;and finally “Third, long COVID appears to have a stronger effect on men than on women” (page 11, line 401). Again, the authors are overselling their results. All these statements are not true, only for two out of three outcomes, namely psychological distress and fatigue, but not for perceived stress (see also Figure 3). Hence, I strongly urge the authors to re-write these sentences so that readers are not misled.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;7;0;Chapter 2 Materials and Methods: Something strange happened to the alignment of heading “2.2 Sample” (page 3, line 128). Please fix this.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;8;0;Table 1 (page 3, line 137): I detected an error in the third column (“COVID-19 infection”). The total sample is reported here as 303. However, the single numbers do not sum up to 303 but rather to 310 (13+74+220+3=310). I know, there were 7 missing values within the 310. However, this table is still wrong, it must be 310 and not 303. Please fix this. The percentage of 87 long COVID (28.7%) then refers to 303 (87/303=28.7%). Hence, I urge the authors to re-calculate percentages in Table 1. Otherwise, this is misleading the readership.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;9;0;Chapter 2.3 Measures: Sometimes the verbal scales are set in italic (e.g., “0=better than ususal”, page 4, line 173) and sometimes not (e.g., “4=very often”, page 5, line 187). Please use a consistent writing style throughout the whole manuscript.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;10;0;Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5: The authors use a very inconsistent style of bold. For example, see Table 4 (page 7, line 269): Column Fatgigue, why is ES not printed in bold? Please use a consistent writing style.
Reviewer_3;Author;1;11;0;Results (page 7, line 274): Sometimes fatigue (page 7, line 274) and sometimes with a capital F (Fatigue, page 7, line 283). Please use a consistent writing style throughout the whole manuscript.

Reviewer_3;Author;3;1;0;"Before a final publication of this paper, I have two minor points left: Wrong column headings in tables: I detected that the authors replaced “GHQ” with “psychological distress” in the text (also “PSS” replaced with “perceived stress”). This is correct. Psychological distress is the latent construct which is measured with the instrument GHQ. Unfortunately, the authors missed to replace GHQ by psychological distress in Table 4 (page 7, line 280) and Table 5 (page 7, line 297; see column headings: not “GHQ”, “Fatigue”, and “Perceived stress” but rather “Psychological distress”, “Fatigue”, and “Perceived stress”). Please correct the two tables."
Reviewer_3;Author;3;2;0;"Wrong use of abbreviations: The authors introduced the abbreviation “GHQ-12” for the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (see page 4, line 161), but wrote in the text only ""GHQ"" (e.g., page 5, line 207; page 6, line 256; page 7, line 274). Please replace every single “GHQ” in the text with the correct abbreviation “GHQ-12”. Please repeat this procedure for “PSS-10” (see page 4, line 185), i.e. replace “PSS” with “PSS-10” in the whole text."
