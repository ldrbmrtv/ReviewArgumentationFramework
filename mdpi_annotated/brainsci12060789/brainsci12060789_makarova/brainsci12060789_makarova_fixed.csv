Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;Since mutations can affect NMDA receptor localization, data on whether AMPA/NMDA ratios changed would be informative. It follows from the methodology that AMPA currents were recorded on a regular basis.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;Please add a chart about tau changes in Figure 3.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;Please verify if the time scale is correct in Fig. 3А.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;A scheme summarizing how different molecular defects can converge on similar NMDAR-mediated EPSCs would be helpful in the discussion
Reviewer_1;Author;1;5;0;A small commentary on the possible functional significance of the identified mutation properties for the pathogenesis of certain diseases would be interesting.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;Even though fig.2aiii shows a comparable relative peak amplitude, which indicates both GOF and LOF rescue NMDA-EPSC in Grin2b-/- neurons, it looks to me that the absolute amplitude in fig.2aii shows a quite big difference in un-transferred groups which are supposed to be comparable, not as consistent as shown in fig.1ci.  How to explain this discrepancy?
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;The supplementary figures are inaccessible.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;The abstract is too long, which does not actually abstract the whole content very well. There are also a number of sentences that are so complicated for easy read. This part should be substantially polished into a shortened and precise style.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and have now computed AMPA-NMDA ratios and included a phrase in lines 424-425 that summarises the statistics for the comparison of AMPA-NMDA ratios between the GluN2B variants (WT and mutants).
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have now measured the decay time constants for the NMDA-EPSCs before and after TCN-201. The graph of the data is shown in a new figure in the supplement, Fig. S4. The finding is insightful, and so we have added a paragraph relating to it in the results section, lines 520-536.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;In answer to the last comment here from the reviewer, the time scale in Fig. 3A is correct – the examples chosen are representative of the group data in terms of the amount of block by TCN-201, but these examples all happen to have faster decays than the examples shown in Figures 1 and 2. In any case, to be more consistent with the formatting in some of the other figures, we have lengthened the scale bar and increased the time proportionally.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;4;4;This is an excellent idea. We have added an additional (final) main text figure, Fig. 7, illustrating how the molecular defects could converge on similar NMDA-EPSCs. We have explained the model in the accompanying figure legend with reference to supporting evidence in other figures.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;5;5;We have added further discussion relating to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders arising from GRIN2B mutations in lines 765-771 of the manuscript.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;6;1;It is hard to know exactly why the measurements of the internal control, untransfected neuron appear to vary between the experimental groups. While an effort was made to try and evoke synaptic responses with a consistent stimulus voltage setting, the effectiveness of the stimulus for evoking an NMDA-EPSC depends on, among other things, the condition of the stimulating electrode (e.g. resistance, stray capacitance, bubbles etc). It was rarely practical to record all mutant conditions in the same experiment, so variation in the stimulating electrode condition over the course of this series of experiments could potentially lead to some apparent differences between untransfected neurons with respect to their mean NMDA-EPSC peak amplitude and charge transfer. What this does serve to illustrate though is how important it was for us to use untransfected neurons as an internal control.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;7;2;The supplementary figures were within the same PDF so we are not sure why the author had trouble gaining accessing to the figures. Assuming the reviewer had trouble understanding the contents of the supplement, we have tried to simplify somewhat the text in the supplementary figure legends.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;8;3;We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, there were many long sentences and the abstract did not capture all of our findings. We have rewritten the abstract to accommodate the reviewer’s suggestions. The abstract is now 311 words long (almost 40 words shorter than the original abstract), has shorter sentences, and includes some summary of the findings reported in all the main figures.
