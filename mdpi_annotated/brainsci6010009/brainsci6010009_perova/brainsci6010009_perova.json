This issue was added to the study limitations in the revised manuscript.\n \u201cIn the present study, neurodevelopmental diagnoses other than 314.xx were not examined among cases and controls. This limitation of the present study should have had a limited impact on the results observed because of the rarity of other neurodevelopmental diagnoses as compared to a 314.xx diagnosis, but future studies could further evaluate this phenomenon.\u201d",
