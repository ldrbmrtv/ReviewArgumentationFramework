      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "although the agency theory and practical function of remuneration committees were described in the manuscript, few efforts were made to give the main theoretical mechanism/logic. Especially since \u201cthere does not appear to be any literature focused on examining the association between the constitution of remuneration committees and the reporting of CSR information\u201d, the authors should provide the theoretical link to propose the hypotheses.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "the dummy of CSR_index is too simple and cannot address the complexity of CSR strategy and CSR disclosure. And so is the independent variable. Many other important control variables should be introduced to the regression, such as, financial performance, the firm size, the firm age, the industry-fixed effects, the country-fixed effects. The results may not be robust without these controls.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "the figure 1 can be re-designed to conform the academic norms."
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "The article is methodologically OK and well written. However, in general, we see many articles like this in the area of social and environmental reporting. Also, the application of agency theory is so common that reading it over and again in the new studies also makes the readers bored these days. Now it is important that the new researchers try to take the research on this area to a new and interesting level. However, I accept this article only for the moderating variable the authors have tested."

      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "The paper studies the relationship between remuneration committees and CSR as well as the moderating role of independent directors. While the paper seems interesting I have several concerns that I would like to share with the authors:\r\n The introduction lacks of motivation. The reader needs to understand why your research question is important",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "The theoretical background is weak. I am not convinced on your explanation on why committees would affect CSR",
      "Reviewer_3.1.3": "Your empirical model needs to be reconsidered. Indeed, I believe you have some omitted control variables which may cause an endogeneity issue and drive your findings",
      "Reviewer_3.1.4": "The paper lacks of robustness checks",
      "Reviewer_3.1.5": "The conclusion needs to be rewritten to highlight the practical contributions of the paper"

      "Author.2.1": "Thank you very much for your words. In our modest opinion, the originality of the paper is: (i) analyse of the association between remuneration committees and CSR disclosure; (ii) examine the moderating effect of independent board in the association between the remuneration committees and the disclosure of CSR information. We have not found previous research focused on these both topics. We have improved the section to clarify the need to extend this line of research",
      "Author.2.2": "Thank you for your suggestion. From a theoretical point of view, we find various references that explain how CSR index is calculated as the ratio between the aggregation of 140 items focused on environmental, social and economic issues and the total number of items analyzed, which codes as 1 if the firm disclose the CSR information related each item, and 0.\r\n - Gallego\u2010\u00c1lvarez, I., & Pucheta\u2010Mart\u00ednez, M.
