      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "However, my main concern with the study is that there were too many analyses presented to interpret in a meaningful way.  ",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The authors should revise the paper providing more theoretical background and accompanying analyses. ",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "With better theoretical framing and a more limited set of analyses, the value of the study results should be more clear.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "I think it would be preferable to describe the measurement of sexual subjectivity shortly after it is defined on p. 3. ",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "Also, a more thorough description of the measurement of the construct and the validity of the measurement could be described in that section.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "On p. 4 the first sentence of second full paragraph, \u201cRegarding sexual subjectivity and its link to greater sexual exploration and experience, one cross-sectional with a sample of females\u201d is missing the word \u201cstudy.\u201d",
      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "The authors could provide more theoretical explanation of why there might be gender differences in sexual subjectivity.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "The authors rely too much on headings to transition between ideas.  The paper would flow more smoothly if some transition sentences were included.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.9": "More specific hypotheses could be proposed.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.10": "The section where research questions are described is worded in an awkward way.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.11": "The reporting of group differences in the participants section might be better placed in the results section after the measures are described.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.12": "The combining of the male and female versions of the sexual subjectivity inventories should be described in more detail, and the validity of creating the subscales should be explained.  Perhaps factor analysis could be used to determine appropriate subscales?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.13": "What were participants told about the purpose of the study?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.14": "There is an increase in Type I error with the multiple t-tests conducted thatshould be addressed. ",
      "Reviewer_1.1.15": "Similarly, there are many correlation tests performed which increases Type I error that needs to be addressed.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.16": "Predictions about how the specific subscales of the inventory might relate to age and experience might be provided to make the results more meaningful (see the comment about theory relating to analyses discussed above)",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "The authors did a nice job of addressing the concerns I pointed out in my previous review.   The paper is more streamlined and focused, and the research findings presented are novel."
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "First, the attrition between Time 1 and Time 2 was substantial (40% of participants), and this is handled using list-wise deletion. That is, any one who did not complete both assessments was not included in the analyses. List-wise deletion can lead to serious bias in results.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Analyses should be re-done using a more sophisticated method for handling missing data, such as multiple imputation or full-information maximum likelihood (Shafer & Graham, 2002, Psychological Methods).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Second, potential participants were \"approached at a university campus\" during orientation week. What percentage of people who were approached agreed to participate?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "How broadly representative of the university population (or the university-age population) is the sample? ",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "At the very least, the Discussion should consider how generalizable these results are.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "Third, although longitudinal data can be a quite powerful tool for understanding change and development, the current analyses squander some of that power.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "The regression results presented in Table 2 test whether sexual behaviors that participants already experienced by Time 1 predicted facets of sexual subjectivity at Time 2, controlling for sexual subjectivity at Time 1. Why would behavior that has already happened contribute to a re-ordering of individuals over the course of the next year? It seems that a more interesting and direct test of the longitudinal effects of sexual behavior on sexual subjectivity would test whether new sexual behaviors (that is, sexual behaviors experienced between Time 1 and Time 2) predict change in sexual subjectivity from Time 1 to Time 2.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.8": "Moreover, the reverse paths -- from sexual subjectivity to future behavior -- are also not tested in this paper.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.9": "More generally, I think the putative timescale of effects of behavior on sexual subjectivity needs more theoretical elaboration. Are behaviors in early adolescence (before age 16), for example, expected to continue to influence the trajectory of sexual subjectivity regardless of later sexual behavior?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.10": "Fourth, each analysis is conducted for each subscale separately, but (with the exception of sexual body-esteem) the scales are consistently (if moderately) intercorrelated.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.11": "I think it would be informative to test whether associations with age or sexual experience group are operating through a general underlying factor of sexual subjectivity versus are unique to specific facets. ",
      "Reviewer_2.1.12": "The shift to a latent factor approach would have the added benefit of allowing the authors to use FIML to account for missing data at T2, and they could thus use their entire sample.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.13": "Fifth, one set of results seems quite contradictory: sense of entitlement to sexual self-pleasure decreased, on average, from Time 1 to Time 2, but sense of entitlement to sexual self-pleasure was positively correlated with age. How do the authors make sense of these result, as participants are one year older at Time 2?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.14": "This contradiction underscores my concern about attrition (point #1); I wonder if the seeming decrease from Time 1 to Time 2 is an artifact of attrition.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.15": "I would, of course, be happy if the authors included a reference to my paper in their Introduction or Discussion."

    "Author": {
      "Author.2.1": "We have now used multiple imputation to maintain all 295 participants in all analyses.",
      "Author.2.2": "We are sorry that we did not keep a tally of the number of students approached.  We have added to the Limitations section of the Discussion about this (see p. 12). It reads,\r\nFirst, the participants in the study were predominantly middle class, Caucasian university students, residing in one region of Australia. There is also the possibility that individuals more interested in sex and relationships chose to participate. Therefore, the results of the current study may have some limited generalizability.",
      "Author.2.3": "We agree that this is very important. We have added the Introduction to expand on these points. Unfortunately we could not conduct these suggested analyses. We had very little change in sexual behavior given the way we measured it. Also, we did not have confidence in estimation of sexual behavior for those who did not participate at Wave 2, which could have increased the change.  Thus, we have maintained our original analyses, but make this comment in the Discussion (see p. 12-13):\r\nSecond, probably because the majority of the participants had already experienced coitus prior to the first data collection and because we measured types of sexual behavior and not frequency or some other aspect of behavior, there was high stability in sexual behavior over the one year of this study. Recent statistics show that the majority of Australian year 10-12 students (approximately 15-17 years) have engaged in some form of sexual behavior [12]. Therefore, in order to capture sexual subjectivity as it emerges and develops most rapidly along with change in sexual behavior, future studies may need to begin with a younger population.\r\nRecently, Hensel et al. [31] found that, in their adolescent participants, sexual self-concept had a bidirectional relationship with sexual experience, and the same may occur for sexual subjectivity. Future research could examine the possibility of bidirectional relationships between sexual subjectivity and sexual behavior. In addition, no previous study has examined the timing of pubertal development and sexual subjectivity. Evidence suggests that adolescents that mature earlier, compared to their peers, form romantic relationships earlier and experience sexual behaviors earlier [11,55]. In the current and past research, the link between age and sexual subjectivity has been relatively weak [34]. Substituting timing of pubertal status for age may provide more evidence regarding individual characteristics that influence differences in sexual subjectivity and its development over time.",
      "Author.2.4": "We have trimmed the paper to focus on two of the five elements of sexual subjectivity and anticipated that these two elements would show different results. Thus, we have maintained the separate analyses of these two elements. Please see the added Hypotheses on p. 5-6.",
      "Author.2.5": "We have removed these analyses from the paper in an attempt to reduce the number of analyses and streamline the entire paper.",
      "Author.2.6": "Thank you for this suggestion. The reference has been added to the paper.",
      "Author.2.7": "We have revised this section (The Current Study, p.5).",
      "Author.2.8": "We have moved this content on group difference to the first section of the Results section.",
      "Author.2.9": "Given our focus on only two element of sexual subjectivity, this was no longer an issue because items were the same on measures for males and females.",
      "Author.2.10": "We have added this information on p. 7 in the Procedure section. It reads:\r\nApproval from the university Human Research Ethics Committee was obtained prior to data collection. At Time 1 (T1), participants were approached at a university campus in Australia in the week before classes commenced (i.e., during orientation week) and asked to participate in a study \"About You and Your Relationships.\" The front cover of the survey described the questions as focused on personal sexual and romantic experiences, and stressed the confidential nature of the survey.",
      "Author.2.11": "Reducing the number of elements of sexual subjectivity has reduced the number of tests performed.",
      "Author.2.12": "We have added hypotheses to the section titled The Current Study on p. 5-6.",
