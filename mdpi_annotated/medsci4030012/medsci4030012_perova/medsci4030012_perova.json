      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "My main issue is with the way the\r\n results are presented. The authors claim that they observed\r\n statistical differences between case and reference groups yet they\r\n do not preform a statistical test, nor give any p-value. Even if\r\n they performed a test, important questions remain on the selection of\r\n the reference. The ancestry of HapMap is not latino so therefore any\r\n test between cases and references will be confounded by ancestry.\r\n The PCA they show is probably capturing those differences instead of\r\n real differences given by disease status and, by the way, I question\r\n the usefulness of this PCA. My suggestion is to offer a better\r\n background for these results by trying to answer two main questions:",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "is the deletion burden observed really exceptional in a population\r\n sample of similar ancestry? To answer this question, I would refer to\r\n the 1000 genomes data where there are Mexicans, Colombians, Puerto\r\n Ricans and Peruvians. There must be available CNV estimations for\r\n these ancestries. If you find good estimates then perhaps a\r\n statistical tests with those as your control group would be more\r\n believable.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "is the deletion burden observed similar to those for\r\n other cancers? Then again there must be estimates of deletion burden\r\n for different types of cancers from TCGA studies. Please cite those.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "The only real statistical inference\r\n they show is on the pathway analysis yet no mention is made on the\r\n abstract. I suggest bringing this result up to the surface and making\r\n it more relevant even from the abstract. You can refer to it as\r\n methodological alternative, in the introduction, for the limited\r\n number of cases and lack of control group; issues that must be tackle\r\n in a larger study.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "I missed a definition of the sample's\r\n ancestry. In the title it refers to Mexican American but in the rest\r\n of the manuscript it is treated as a latino population. Note that\r\n there are differences in admixture in the latino population depending\r\n of their country of origin. Studies on the 1000 genomes show\r\n differences between Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Mexicans and\r\n Peruvians. Therefore, if the authors can state that their sample is essentially\r\n Mexican that would be more informative and precise. I would then\r\n limit the use of latino. However if the ancestry is only self\r\n reported as latino, then I would write latino in the title and\r\n mention the issue of genetic variability between latinos in the\r\n discussion.",

      "Author.2.1": "thank you for reviewer\u2019s comments, we made changes accordingly. We added statistical analysis for CNA association between case and reference groups (please see page 5).",
      "Author.2.2": "For the questions of \u201cis the deletion burden observed really exceptional in a population sample of similar ancestry\u201d, we agree with the reviewer\u2019s comment. We did the analysis a couple of years ago, at that time, there is no CNV data from the 1000 genome for Mexicans, Colombians, Puerto Ricans and Peruvians, however, there is data for the admixed populations, thus we used this for this study. There might be some difficulty to do more analysis since our statistician and bioinformatics person left the department and we are in the process of hiring somebody for this role. At the same, we continue in recruiting more subjects with cervical cancers to further confirm our findings. Moreover, in the discussion, we have list this as one of the limitations in page 8 \u201c2) there might be bias of the CNA identified in cervical cancer for the Mexican Americans since we used the 1000 Genome admixed populations, not Mexican Americans, thus, we current recruit more subjects with cervical cancer from the same population and plan to validate the findings in more samples;\u201d",
      "Author.2.3": "For the question of \u201cis the deletion burden observed similar to those for other cancers? Then again there must be estimates of deletion burden for different types of cancers from TCGA studies\u201d, our response is that we did search of CNAs observed in other cancer based on TCGA studies, although there are limited studies, we addressed this issue in the discussion section (page 8) \u201c\u2026Using the TCGA data, a recent study identified nine regions of deletion that were unique to ER+ post menopause tumors in patients with breast cancer, including deletion in 7p22.3 where our newly identified deletion in cases only located and it contains known tumor suppressor gene\u201d.",
      "Author.2.4": "Now we added a sentence of \u201cMoreover, the pathway analysis revealed endometrial cancer and estrogen signaling pathways associated with this cancer (P < 0.05) using the KEGG\u201d in the abstract as the reviewer\u2019s suggestion. In addition, in the introduction section, we added \u201cWe are aware of the limited number of cases and lack of control group.

      "Author.2.7": "thank you for the comments. We also realized this issue which is due to that the color green overlaps with the other colors, thus it cannot be distinguished, and we have tried different color combinations without help. Now we made changes of the figure and legend.",
