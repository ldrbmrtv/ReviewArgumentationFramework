      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The figures should be improved in quality so the work would take on another aspect. Figure 7b is not very credible, when U937 become macrogphages adhere to the plate and assume the morphology of a macrophage. the figure is not clear and not well visible. The authors should also show the flow cytometers panels related to cd68 and cd14. This figure does not convince me very much.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "The authors have now addressed all my major initial comments."

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "Small comment, the supplementary Fig. S4B would need some compensation work....this would be better to correct before final approval for publication ( up to editor).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Also the gating strategy on Fig. 4d ( is going in right direction), what I am missing here is the exclusion of dead cells?)."
    },
    "Reviewer_3": {
      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "The data presented by the authors are robust and interesting but are based on a single AML cell line, which is not a bonafide AML cell line (derived from the pleural effusion of a 37-year-old, White, male patient with histiocytic lymphoma, according to ATCC). Thus, authors should discuss limitations in interpreting their findings."

      "Author.2.2": "We have included what we have written below for your convenience:\r\n \u201cThe U937 cell line was originally isolated from the pleural effusion of a patient with histiocytic lymphoma [42]. Early characterisation studies showed that U937 cells differed from typical lymphoblastoid cell lines [42]. Because of their pro-monocytic phenotype, many regard the U937 cell line to be representative of an AML subtype M5, under the French-American-British (FAB) classification system [43\u201346]. This pro-monocytic phenotype and cytochemistry, has accounted for the wide use of U937 cells as a model to study AML, including ROS mediated monocyte to macrophage transition [32,49,50]. We identified U937 cells as having a relatively low basal expression of BCAT1 compared other myeloid cell lines [49], which would allow an effective comparison between BCAT1 overexpressing cells to the vector control. Taken together, the U937 cell line presented as a good cellular model to study the putative antioxidant effect of the BCAT1 CXXC motif in myeloid differentiation, which is a defining feature of AML [50]. However, our study is limited to a single FAB subtype model. Future work could extend our analysis and examine the antioxidant capacity of the BCAT1 CXXC motif in other FAB subtype models, for example HL60 (AML, M2) and NB4 (AML M3 aka APL) [45].\u201d",
