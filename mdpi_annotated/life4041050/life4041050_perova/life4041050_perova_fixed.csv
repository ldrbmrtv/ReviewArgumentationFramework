Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;"The place of RNA in LUCA (page 2): In search of features that are more conserved
 (carrying deep phylogenetic memory) than the sequence of genes, Wächtershäuser focuses on a paper
 of his in Systematic and Applied Microbiology (1998) that uses gene content and order of microbial
 genomes to make inferences about the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life. He then mines the significance of some of the conserved chromosomal segments in light of some other evidence.
 The exercise is at places compelling, but forgets some recent, very global and exhaustive analyses that
 also use highly conserved biological features to reconstruct the makeup of LUCA (e.g., gene order,
 3D molecular structure, molecular functions). See for example PubMed references PMID: 17370266,
 PMID: 21612591, and PMID: 17908824, which are in line with some conclusions derived from the
 alignment of Figure 1. The fact that these other analyses make use of hundreds of genomes to infer the
 ancient biochemistry of LUCA complements and strengthens the preliminary and fragmentary analysis
 of only 19 of them by the author, which also excludes eukaryotic genomes from the set (understandably,
 few sequenced genomes were available in 1998, and eukaryotes are in general “master rearrangers”)."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;"Given my interest in the bioinformatics of gene content and order, I took the liberty of studying the
 brief Systematic & Applied Microbiology paper to check the validity of the “reconstruction” methods
 of Figure 1. The algorithmic implementation that is described is quite raw and does not extract important
 information that is embedded in the clusters of conserved gene segments. Important algorithms have
 been devised since the initial work of Sankoff in the sixties and seventies to do exactly that. I refer to
 the work of Pevzner, Tesler and Bourque as good examples, but also of Warnow. I also recommend
 visiting GRIMM (http://grimm.ucsd.edu/GRIMM/) and perhaps using the server to confirm or extract
 additional information from the alignments that are summarized in Figure 1. The Wächtershäuser
 algorithm makes use of conserved elements of gene content and order but discards information provided
 by the actual rearrangement operations that erase gene order history. The algorithm does not describe
 how gene homology was detected, how the limited set of genes was selected, and how the alignments
 were constructed (I imagine by hand). It is not clear if a guiding tree was used in the alignment (though
 this is mentioned in Line 65), since this is not made explicit in the 1998 publication. An alignment
 implies a tree but usually alignment algorithms are greedy and problematic and represent the most
 important limiting step of a phylogeny (the field is thus moving to the joint alignment and tree
 reconstruction). Therefore, I do not think the ancestors were properly reconstructed (the tracing of
 features in ancestor nodes of trees are not described, nor the actual trees). Regardless of all of these
 limitations, the tight conservation of certain segments is enough to show the existence of a core of
 ribosomal proteins that is universally present in cellular organisms. This in itself is valuable. Of course,
 a sample of 19 microbes may not be enough to encompass molecular diversity and the absence of
 Eukarya may also be problematic for any global evolutionary statement. In other words, the risks of
 sampling bias are clearly present and should be mentioned in the manuscript."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;"The list of common genes in the alignment of Table 1 is enriched in small and large subunit ribosomal
 proteins that are the most ancient of the ribosomal set, according to the Caetano-Anolles theorem that is
 mentioned later in the manuscript. Interestingly, the most ancient of them are clustered toward the 5’
 end of the genomic sequences that were aligned (S12, S17, S5, S4 and L2, L3 and L24). Could this imply
 a possible ancient segmental duplication? Also interesting is the placement of the most ancient ribosomal
 protein S12 between exactly two polymerase (beta and beta prime) and elongation factor (entry and
 translocation) genes (separated by single and much more derived ribosomal proteins). Could this be an
 ancient memory of the ribosome mediating translation and replication? A commentary would enhance
 the value of the section."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;"In terms of the genome organization of LUCA (Line 105), there are numerous arguments in favor of
 an RNA ancestral genome and the late unfolding of DNA as genetic repository (perhaps through
 viruses). I cannot understand how 2'-hydroxy groups could destabilize the molecule and lead to
 “intramolecular self-destruction” (Line 107). RNA has the wonderful property of folding in search of
 energetic and kinetic minima. These processes make use of a frustrated landscape, which is powerful in
 terms of its biological potential (stability, function, information). It is much more versatile than the rigid
 DNA alternative, which is enriched in the ‘information’ capacity. None of them have “self destruction”
 properties, which would have been weeded out by selection and self-organization very early in
 “chemical” evolution. In turn, everything about LUCA should be considered quite modern and far away
 from an initial FeS world. I refer to the work of Daniel Lundin and colleagues in Sweden about the rather
 late rise of some structures of the ribonuceotide reductase enzymes needed to built the DNA polymers.
 The Maurel theorem stands if one thinks of single genome molecules. But what if there were many short
 RNA genomes, as anticipated by Woese, each perhaps linked to different and ancient tRNA-like
 cofactors? As the author mentions, LUCA is contemporary to a rather complex biochemistry, with
 numerous structures harboring a multitude of active and allosteric sites in proteins, most of which drive
 central enzymatic functions."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;5;0;"In Line 114, the role of chromosomal rearrangement in evolution is not well described. What are the
 effects of genome rearrangements? Several scenarios are possible, including: (1) Genes remain linked probably because it is more efficient to transcribe genes that produce interacting proteins (part of
 complexes) than those that are not; (2) Genes remain linked if they are of relatively recent origin
 (rearrangement has not had the change to split them apart); (3) Genes remain linked if they are part of
 functional groups historically united by genomic regions (encoding metabolic functions or rRNA?); this
 includes genes sharing an operon structure for economy purposes in highly reduced organisms such as
 bacteria; (4) Genes remain linked because they originated when genomic rearrangements were not
 biochemically motivated and their sequence makeup was later refractory to rearrangement hotspots.
 There is a rich literature about rearrangement, hotspots and many processes related to these (including
 domain organization in proteins). Some discussion in this front could be clarifying."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;6;0;"In relation to comments of Line 188 onwards, Di Giulio, Caetano-Anolles and others have suggested
 that the genetic code started to unfold prior to LUCA but continue to do so once life diversified. The
 corollary, is that the complete canonical set of amino acids may have not been encoded in LUCA.
 In terms of metabolic and biochemical competency, there are numerous and interesting studies, which
 have not been cited (especially in origins and evolution of modern metabolism). This includes the
 coevolution theory of the genetic code, the coexistence of prebiotic chemistries with modern metabolic
 reactions (recently studied for nucleotide metabolism), and theories about the origin of translation."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;7;0;"Thermal course of evolution (Page 6): Why a focus on thermal energy? The framework
 should be on thermodynamics, energy dissipation and information, all of which are linked. What is
 thermally upward or downward adaptation? Is it conquering niches on Earth or a process involving
 molecular makeup? Vocabulary and definitions are murky, especially related to the links of
 environmental thermal fluctuations, energy of folding and stability of polymers. Subsection (1) must be
 rewritten to help the reader understand the ideas. Should all adaptations comply with maximizing energy dissipation? How can this be reconciled with upward and downward trends? No references are provided
 despite the rich literature underscoring the controversial link between physics, information theory and
 biology. If the focus is conquering planetary niches, then perhaps reference the contrasting views and
 some of their proponents (deep sea versus surface; thermophilic versus mesophilic, etc.). Further
 elaboration of the Wolfenden theorem appears relevant and its connections to what is known about the
 origin and evolution of metabolism also of importance."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;8;0;"Place of RNA in the origin and early evolution of translation/Pre-translational coding of
 peptides. The view that is presented in this crucial segment posits a pre-translational mechanism
 (side-by-side tRNA mediated coding) that very much resembles the ribosomal entropic system, which
 could be very advanced. What if the pre-translational coding was assembly line-like and mediated by
 the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases themselves? See PMID: 23991065 for one such alternative and a
 related previous model (PMID: 22210458). This would also match commentary of a possible early origin
 of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis machinery compared to that of the ribosome."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;9;0;"General overview. While the grand finale “Nothing in evolution makes sense except in the
 light of chemical predetermination” is impressive and summarizes the championing work of the author,
 chemical predetermination may apply to the very early stages of evolution and not to many of the stages
 described in the manuscript. How much chemical predetermination can there be with polymers as these
 explore a minute fraction of the space they make possible? In the enthalpic-entropic gradient that is
 proposed, there is also a gradient from “predetermination” to historical contingency. The boundaries of
 such a gradient is murky and the final statement may not apply to much of modern biochemistry, once
 proteins start to achieve stable complex structure and much earlier that the time of LUCA. In fact, the
 genome rearrangements that underlie Figure 1 are testament to the historical contingencies that were
 already at play in LUCA and not to chemical predetermination."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;10;0;"Title. The title does not encompass appropriately the wide subject matter covered by the
 manuscript. I suggest “The place of RNA in the origin and early evolution of life”."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;11;0;Line 39. And what is the place of proteins in all that?

 reconstruction of ancestors from extant information."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;13;0;"Line 40. Interpolation of LUCA and competing theories of the origin of life. In my view, LUCA
 is not a theory of origin of life. It is a theory of origin of diversified cellular life."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;14;0;"Line 52. Not only genes are gained and lost with time (Woese theorem), but also mutations
 accumulate to saturation in genes making homology statements difficult. This has been made
 explicit abundantly in the molecular evolutionary literature. A focus on gene content and order
 makes only sense if such homologies at gene level are preserved (if not there will be artifactual
 losses in the alignments).This should be highlighted in the text because it is relevant to the
 validity of the alignment of Figure 1, making its significance more important."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;15;0;Line 62: Change “multiply” to “multiple”.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;16;0;"Line 406. “LUCA protein cycle”. Why bring LUCA to a link with the proposed “protein cycle”.
 LUCA is just the last of a chain of ancestor of diversified life. If the protein cycle requires a
 coupling of the enthalpic activation of amino acids and the entropic biosynthetic action of a
 primordial ribosome, then perhaps it is better to call it “ribocellular protein cycle”, since this
 coupling marks the start of modern cells, not necessarily “modern diversified cells” (i.e., LUCA"

 theory or proposal?"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;"Line 716: The biosyntheses of His and Trp are not so closely related. They only have in common that
 they use phosphoribosediphosphate as substrate and therefore share two related enzymes."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;"In the iron sulfur world the surface metabolism prevents the diffusion of the fixed products into the

Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;The three references have been noticed with gratitude and included in the MS.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;"The 1998 paper leaves much to be desired. Its deficiencies reflect the excitement of the first
 hour. The state of the art at that time may be gleaned from an authoritative paper that came to the
 opposite conclusion: A.R. Mushegian and E.V. Koonin “Gene order is not conserved in bacterial
 evolution”. TIG 1996, 12, 289–290. The gene cluster table of 1998 was mainly retrieved from the
 annotations in published genomes and constructed manually with paper and pencil. The state of
 information technology at that time is reflcted by the fact that the table was folded an individually pasted
 by hand into each issue by the publisher."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"The 1998 paper contemplated speculatively a combination of small-scale gene doubling (as
 evidenced by the immediate neighborhood of EF-Tu/EF-G) and of a large-scale gene cluster doubling
 (as evidenced by the spacing between secE/secY and rpoH-A/rpoD) with the hope of a future deeper
 understanding based on folding structures. Now the referee makes an exciting suggestion that may, if
 executed successfully, go some way to satisfy that hope."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;4;4;"The self-cleavage of RNA by 2'-OH is a chemical textbook fact. The 2'-OH group has the
 proper position and orientation for a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate bridge. The kinetics of the
 reaction is greatly favored by the 5-membered ring structure of the resulting cyclic phospho-bisester.
 The length of the RNA molecule is not relevant since each nucleophilic attack causes destruction of the
 chain. The effect should not be confused with the length-dependent “error catastrophe” of accumulating
 mutations of RNA. Incidentally, some anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases are ancient, while others
 (aerobic ones) are later inventions."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;5;5;"Genome rearrangements are certainly important during later evolution of the phyla. At the
 level of LUCA, i.e., prior to the splitting of the domains, it is not clear, if and to what extent
 rearrangements of the modern style occurred. In this regard we should bear in mind that the LUCA
 genome may have exhibited sense-antisense coding on both strands as suggested by Rodin and Carter.
 This position has been adopted and discussed in the present paper. Therefore, speculations concerning
 possible genome rearrangements may be a bridge too far."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;6;6;"The present analysis comes to the conclusion that the sets of canonical amino acids and bases
 as well as the genetic triplet code were largely complete at the level of LUCA. The Wong coevolution
 theory of the genetic code has been discussed in detail. The literature comprises numerous proposals
 concerning the origin of translation and other aspects of the genetic machinery. A review of all these
 proposals and many others is beyond the scope of the present paper. The present paper is a research
 paper and not a review paper. It aims at a comprehensive account of early evolution from the origin of
 life all the way to LUCA. This puts a systematic constraint on literature selection. An effort
 (unfortunately fallible) has been made to include all those references that integrate with the main lines
 of the present account into a coherent account. Contributions by others that have the character of
 theoretical modules that fit well into this account have been termed “theorems” with names of the main
 authors attached. A reference to a paper on nucleotide biosynthesis phylogeny is now cited in Section 7."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;7;7;"Based on the valuable criticism Section 2 has been extensively revised. Terminology has been
 clarified. This Section has a rather restricted purpose. It provides chemical arguments for the
 proposition that the pioneer organisms could only exist at high temperature and that the subsequent
 forms of life remained hyperthermophilic for a long time until much later an irreversible evolution
 generated organisms that required lower and lower temperatures. This conclusion places severe
 constraints on all aspects of the evolution of the genetic machinery. The fascinating topics of
 thermodynamics, energy dissipation and information are outside the scope of the paper."
