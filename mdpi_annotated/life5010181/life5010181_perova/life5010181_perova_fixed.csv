Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;"Overall a beautifully written, wonderfully presented, paper with clear concepts, methods and
 proposals that significantly contribute to original knowledge in the field."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;"The authors write: “In these initial stages, the emergence of bistability will serve as a proxy for the
 emergence of other chemical novelties in the vesicle reactor model.” The authors probably means
 that the existence of more than one stable regime could consent regime changes, but this situation
 do not indicates how these changes appear: in the article, the change is stimulated by means of a
 deliberated injection of chemical substances from outside. So, I think that the appearance of
 novelties requires a different order of considerations, whereas the bistability plays possibly the role
 of novelties amplification and consolidation (in particular conditions). The same observation can be
 done for the word “innovation”, used on the abstract and at Line 45. In order to avoid
 misunderstandings, I think that the authors should avoid these expressions, ad use the words “regime
 change”, or similar concepts."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;"Note 4 presents a very important issue: why the inner chemical environment is different from the
 external one, if the running chemical reactions are the same? The presence of particular features of
 the vesicle interior or of entrapped catalysts seem a too easy and ad hoc hypothesis. A useful
 reference proposing an explanation of this symmetry breaking (without requiring different
 conditions in internal and external environments) could be “R. Serra, M. Villani Mechanism for the
 formation of density gradients through semipermeable membranes Physical Review E 87, 2013”."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;"How the authors derive the range [0.9, 101/3] for the so called “reduced surface” index? In Figure
 1d, Lines 21/3 and 41/3 have some particular meanings, or are plotted mainly to ease the figure
 comprehension? Could the authors add some indications about the derivation of these upper limits?"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;"The authors write (case 1): “of the 5000 parameter set tested under constant surface area, 82% (4098)
 gave a single fixed point, 321 15.7% (785) gave two fixed points, and 2.3% (117) no fixed points.”
 How this statistics compare with a similar one, performed on a similar chemical situation without
 container? Could the authors add the results of the same within a not confined environment?"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;5;0;"Line 89: “where the vesicle has again fixed surface area, but now variable volume” should be:
 “where the vesicle has again fixed surface area, but not variable volume”."

Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;This review does not require any action on our part.
Author;Reviewer_2;2;2;1;"Here, the reviewer did not like our use of the particular words “novelty” and “innovation”.
 o Use of the word novelty
 − Instances of “chemical novelty” in the manuscript replaced by “emergent chemical behaviour”.
 − On Page 8, after Equation 8, we removed sentence:
 The emergence of bistability will serve as a proxy for the emergence of other chemical novelties in
 the vesicle reactor model.
 Replaced whole paragraph, to read:
 In particular, in these initial stages, we will focus on the emergence of bistability in the vesicle
 reactor model—a dynamical feature deducible directly from the number and stability of the fixed
 points present (i.e., two asymptotically stable points separated by an unstable saddle point). We also
 expect that more complicated dynamical regimes could also be present in the model, like
 multi-stability or global phase space features such as limit cycles giving rise to sustained
 oscillations. However, investigation of these regimes will be deferred to later work: for the time
 being, the “emergent chemical behavior” referred to in the title will be restricted to bistability.
 We think this is a clearer explanation, and also uses the word “regime” suggested by the reviewer.
 o Use of the word innovation
 We kept the 2 occurrences of the word “innovation” in the abstract and the introduction.
 An innovation is defined as a “new method, idea or product” in the dictionary. We use the word to refer
 to new emergent chemical behaviour that the whole vesicle system exhibits (e.g., expanded steady
 states), which did not exist before. We think the use of this word is acceptable."
Author;Reviewer_2;2;3;2;"we added a new footnote, to explain our standing on this issue:
 Reference 36: In this work, concentrations outside the vesicle are set as system parameters.
 However, we make no commitment to the type of environment the vesicle is embedded in or how these
 concentrations are maintained. Our purpose is simply to show that bistability can exist in the model for
 certain sets of outside concentrations. Exploration of the model in explicit environments is deferred to
 future work."
Author;Reviewer_2;2;4;3;"Reference 11 has been added after Equation 10, to point the reader to where to find
 information about phi limits was first discussed. Repeating this information here would complicate the
 paper. The lines Phi = 2^(1/3) and 4^(1/3) in Figure 1d have now been explained."
Author;Reviewer_2;2;5;4;"It is difficult to make a direct and meaningful comparison like this. Without a container, the
 reaction system has less parameters, and thus the sampled parameter space is smaller. The aim in the
 paper, was to simply show that encapsulating a Schlogl model which was bistable in bulk condition,
 seemed to destroy this bistability."
