      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "The authors write: \u201cIn these initial stages, the emergence of bistability will serve as a proxy for the \r\nemergence of other chemical novelties in the vesicle reactor model.\u201d The authors probably means \r\nthat the existence of more than one stable regime could consent regime changes, but this situation \r\ndo not indicates how these changes appear: in the article, the change is stimulated by means of a \r\ndeliberated injection of chemical substances from outside. So, I think that the appearance of \r\nnovelties requires a different order of considerations, whereas the bistability plays possibly the role \r\nof novelties amplification and consolidation (in particular conditions). The same observation can be \r\ndone for the word \u201cinnovation\u201d, used on the abstract and at Line 45. In order to avoid \r\nmisunderstandings, I think that the authors should avoid these expressions, ad use the words \u201cregime \r\nchange\u201d, or similar concepts.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "Note 4 presents a very important issue: why the inner chemical environment is different from the \r\nexternal one, if the running chemical reactions are the same? The presence of particular features of \r\nthe vesicle interior or of entrapped catalysts seem a too easy and ad hoc hypothesis. A useful \r\nreference proposing an explanation of this symmetry breaking (without requiring different \r\nconditions in internal and external environments) could be \u201cR. Serra, M. Villani Mechanism for the \r\nformation of density gradients through semipermeable membranes Physical Review E 87, 2013\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "How the authors derive the range [0.9, 101/3] for the so called \u201creduced surface\u201d index? In Figure \r\n1d, Lines 21/3 and 41/3 have some particular meanings, or are plotted mainly to ease the figure \r\ncomprehension? Could the authors add some indications about the derivation of these upper limits?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "The authors write (case 1): \u201cof the 5000 parameter set tested under constant surface area, 82% (4098) \r\ngave a single fixed point, 321 15.7% (785) gave two fixed points, and 2.3% (117) no fixed points.\u201d \r\nHow this statistics compare with a similar one, performed on a similar chemical situation without \r\ncontainer? Could the authors add the results of the same within a not confined environment?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Line 89: \u201cwhere the vesicle has again fixed surface area, but now variable volume\u201d should be: \r\n\u201cwhere the vesicle has again fixed surface area, but not variable volume\u201d.",

      "Author.2.2": "Here, the reviewer did not like our use of the particular words \u201cnovelty\u201d and \u201cinnovation\u201d. \r\no Use of the word novelty \r\n\u2212 Instances of \u201cchemical novelty\u201d in the manuscript replaced by \u201cemergent chemical behaviour\u201d. \r\n\u2212 On Page 8, after Equation 8, we removed sentence: \r\nThe emergence of bistability will serve as a proxy for the emergence of other chemical novelties in \r\nthe vesicle reactor model. \r\nReplaced whole paragraph, to read: \r\nIn particular, in these initial stages, we will focus on the emergence of bistability in the vesicle \r\nreactor model\u2014a dynamical feature deducible directly from the number and stability of the fixed \r\npoints present (i.e., two asymptotically stable points separated by an unstable saddle point). We also \r\nexpect that more complicated dynamical regimes could also be present in the model, like \r\nmulti-stability or global phase space features such as limit cycles giving rise to sustained \r\noscillations. However, investigation of these regimes will be deferred to later work: for the time \r\nbeing, the \u201cemergent chemical behavior\u201d referred to in the title will be restricted to bistability. \r\nWe think this is a clearer explanation, and also uses the word \u201cregime\u201d suggested by the reviewer. \r\no Use of the word innovation \r\nWe kept the 2 occurrences of the word \u201cinnovation\u201d in the abstract and the introduction. \r\nAn innovation is defined as a \u201cnew method, idea or product\u201d in the dictionary. We use the word to refer \r\nto new emergent chemical behaviour that the whole vesicle system exhibits (e.g., expanded steady \r\nstates), which did not exist before. We think the use of this word is acceptable.",
      "Author.2.3": "we added a new footnote, to explain our standing on this issue: \r\nReference 36: In this work, concentrations outside the vesicle are set as system parameters. \r\nHowever, we make no commitment to the type of environment the vesicle is embedded in or how these \r\nconcentrations are maintained. Our purpose is simply to show that bistability can exist in the model for \r\ncertain sets of outside concentrations. Exploration of the model in explicit environments is deferred to \r\nfuture work.",
      "Author.2.4": "Reference 11 has been added after Equation 10, to point the reader to where to find \r\ninformation about phi limits was first discussed. Repeating this information here would complicate the \r\npaper. The lines Phi = 2^(1/3) and 4^(1/3) in Figure 1d have now been explained.",
      "Author.2.5": "It is difficult to make a direct and meaningful comparison like this. Without a container, the \r\nreaction system has less parameters, and thus the sampled parameter space is smaller. The aim in the \r\npaper, was to simply show that encapsulating a Schlogl model which was bistable in bulk condition, \r\nseemed to destroy this bistability.",
