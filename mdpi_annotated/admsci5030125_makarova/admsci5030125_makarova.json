    "Reviewer_1": {
      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "My principle concern is with the logical construction of the paper. Given the number and apparent scope of adaptations of the CIRA method, I am not sure that I am more familiar with CIRA or its advantages having read the paper than I was previously.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "While the authors describe the process as a case study, the procedure they use is a table top exercise. Rather than developing a case through research, interviews, or observation, they presented a stylized scenario to academic peers for discussion.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "Given the authors stated goal of promoting the CIRA technique and approach to demonstrating its uses, I would recommend re-formatting the paper as a pedagogical tool. Rather than claiming to validate the method, focus on a detailed step by step examination of its implementation using a known outcome.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "The paper needs smoother transitions between topics on pages 2-7. The authors should add one or two lines smoothing the flow for the reader, rather than relying on subject headings. Traditionally, limitations are listed towards the end of the paper."
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "The paper is on the one hand quite verbose, but with respect to the peer review incomplete.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "The line of reasoning in the paper is not easy to follow.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "The paper can become stronger if it limits itself to the Peer Review Ring Incident and will look at the various aspects of that scenario including risk reducing measures",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Much of what is analyzed and concluded is rather obvious.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "What are the conclusions about the root cause? Or are there multiple root causes? And what definition of root cause is used?",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "Few minor linguistic glitches have been indicated by annotations in the text."
    },
    "Reviewer_3": {
      "Reviewer_3.1.1": "Regarding section 2, literature review should usually be structured with explicitly stating what types of methodologies have already been developed/are existing in the context of what you studied or conducted your research on.",
      "Reviewer_3.1.2": "If so, there is not enough explanation about the CIRA and the person(s) who developed this method. ",
      "Reviewer_3.1.3": "Also there is not enough clarification and elaboration on the differences of your  work on CIRA and your customizations comparing to the original methodology.",
      "Reviewer_3.3.1": "There is a need for some editing; e.g. grammatical and punctuation corrections, elements in the text."
    },
    "Author": {
      "Author.2.1": "I have elaborated on all the areas you commented, and clarified the CIRA methodology and hopefully my contribution.",
      "Author.2.2": "I have added the results of the stakeholder analysis to improve the communication our view of the PRP.",
      "Author.2.3": "I have tried to address your other concerns by improving the scope of the work, revising the method section, results, discussion and conclusion.",
      "Author.4.1": "I have included all your suggested changes together with a major spellcheck.",
      "Author.0.0": "Paper"
