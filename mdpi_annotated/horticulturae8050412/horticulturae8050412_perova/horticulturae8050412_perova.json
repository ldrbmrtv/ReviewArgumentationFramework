      "Author.2.4": "We feel sorry for the unclear statement. In a previous study (Ding, 2021), the LlWRKY39 promoter was fused to a pGreenII-0800-LUC vector using a recombinant ligase (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The constructed vector and an empty vector (control) were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pSoup), which was used to transform N. benthamiana leaves. The LUC signal increased profoundly after subjection to HS (37\u2103), although under normal conditions (room temperature), the LUC signal was very low, which implied that HS activated the promoter activity of LlWRKY39. In this study, the experimental operations, reagents and plant materials were were the same as the previous study, except for the different treatment conditions. Therefore, we suggest that salt stress can induce the activity of the OfSPL11 promoter.",
