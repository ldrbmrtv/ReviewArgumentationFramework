      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "There is now available a great resource for the gene discovery in Haloferax volcanii (Kiljunen et al \r\n2014: BMC Biology). A comprehensive insertion mutant library has been generated for this model \r\narchaeon in order to facilitate gene discovery. This should be mentitioned and discussed in the text; i.e., \r\nhow this resource could be used to assign functions for genes."
