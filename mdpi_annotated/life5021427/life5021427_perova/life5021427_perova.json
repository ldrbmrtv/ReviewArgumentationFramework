However, being experts in their field the authors\r\n might not be aware that for readers less familiar with the metabolism/physiology of archaea, the\r\n examples are not always easy to follow, such as examples given on p. 7 starting line 196 (The main\r\n difference here is between a ferredoxin-dependent and/or a NAD-dependent decarboxylation of\r\n pyruvate into acetyl-CoA?/A few lines later when I read that \u201chalophilic archaea do not contain the\r\n coenzyme methanopterin\u201d, I had to go back and reread the preceding sentences to get an idea of the\r\n argument.), p. 10 starting Line 299, and p. 12 starting Line 354."

A comprehensive insertion mutant library has been generated for this model\r\n archaeon in order to facilitate gene discovery. This should be mentitioned and discussed in the text; i.e.,\r\n how this resource could be used to assign functions for genes."
