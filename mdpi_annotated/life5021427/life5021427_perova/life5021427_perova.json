However, being experts in their field the authors\n might not be aware that for readers less familiar with the metabolism/physiology of archaea, the\n examples are not always easy to follow, such as examples given on p. 7 starting line 196 (The main\n difference here is between a ferredoxin-dependent and/or a NAD-dependent decarboxylation of\n pyruvate into acetyl-CoA?/A few lines later when I read that \u201chalophilic archaea do not contain the\n coenzyme methanopterin\u201d, I had to go back and reread the preceding sentences to get an idea of the\n argument.), p. 10 starting Line 299, and p. 12 starting Line 354."

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "There is now available a great resource for the gene discovery in Haloferax volcanii (Kiljunen et al\n 2014: BMC Biology). A comprehensive insertion mutant library has been generated for this model\n archaeon in order to facilitate gene discovery. This should be mentitioned and discussed in the text; i.e.,\n how this resource could be used to assign functions for genes."

In this\n paragraph we mention three approaches that will facilitate gene discovery, among them large-scale\n screening techniques as exemplified by the insertion mutant library pointed out by the referee.",
