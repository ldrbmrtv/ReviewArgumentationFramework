      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The title of the manuscript is too general and should mention PB2 position 526 and also that this work was done exclusively using Indonesian H5N1 clade 2.1 viruses.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The data included in Fig. 1 seem much more limited than what is currently available from sequence databases and include very few strains from 2007 and later. What is the amino acid at PB2 position 526 for the 107 human isolates and 101 avian isolates currently available from GISAID? The lack of information about PB2 526 in recent viruses makes it harder to translate the results from this study into actions. Additional phylogenetic analyses on PB2 526R/K in recent strains is needed to make this work relevant to the suggestion of the authors that PB2 position 526 should be screened to identify viruses with zoonotic potential. The human isolates with PB2 526R are in a different clade than most of the avian viruses with PB2 K526R. What are the genetic changes responsible for this difference. Also, the authors should exclude that the important phylogenetic differences (526R vs 526K, and human 526R vs avian 526R) are due to differences in the way that these viruses were propagated (eggs, MDCKs, MDCK-SIAT1, etc)?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The authors associate the higher number of human infections in Indonesia with PB2 526R. This association requires an analysis of PB2 526R in other H5N1 clades than 2.1 to show that 526R is indeed absent/rare in regions where the number of human cases is lower than in Indonesia.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "Line 313: \u201c[\u2026], these results clearly show that K526R substitution in PB2 significantly enhances virus replication in mammalian cells, [\u2026]\u201d. This line should state that the K526R substitution enhances replication in the cells used in the experiments described in this manuscript.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "Line 332: \u201c[\u2026], supporting the idea that the K526R substitution is critical for infection of mice with Indonesian H5N1 viruses\u201d. This statement is not correct. As shown in Fig. 6C 526K viruses do replicate in mice. Please adjust to state that 526R enhances replication.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "Line 379: \u201c[\u2026], which suggests that 526R PB2 has no fitness cost [\u2026]. Fitness costs may be very subtle and hard to measure. Therefore, the results of the analysis done for this manuscript do not show that 526R PB2 has no fitness cost, but merely that a fitness cost was not detected with the method used here. Please adjust the text accordingly.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "Line 384: I think the conclusion from line 384 is an overinterpretation of the results from this work and should be rephrased. Suggest to change to: Taken together, these results indicate that host adaptive mutations in the PB2 gene enhance H5N1 virus replication in mice and that K526R PB2 is a pre-existing adaptive marker present in Indonesian H5N1 viruses currently circulating in avian species which supports increased virus replication in mammalian cells.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "Line 426: The authors state that \u201c[\u2026], the K526R PB2 substitution in Indonesian H5N1 viruses is rarely associated with either E627K or D701N\u201d, which is not supported by data provided in the manuscript. A more extensive and updated phylogenetic analysis like suggested above could support this statement.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.9": "It is surprising that the analysis from Fig. 7 was performed only in A549 as representative for mammalian cells, and not in MDCKs like was done for the analysis in from Fig. 3. Please clarify this choice.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.10": "Line 441: replace indicate by suggest.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.11": "Line 81: \u201c[\u2026], it seems possible that for the genetic constellation of Indonesian H5N1 viruses optimal function of the polymerase complex for virus replication is independent of E627K, and instead requires K526R adaptive substitution\u201d. There is no indication that K526R is required as an adaptive solution, there may be other adaptive markers that happened to not get selected during evolution. Change requires to utilizes.",
