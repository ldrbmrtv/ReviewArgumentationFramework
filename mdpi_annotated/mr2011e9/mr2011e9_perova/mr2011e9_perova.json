      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "The title of the manuscript is too general and should mention PB2 position 526 and also that this work was done exclusively using Indonesian H5N1 clade 2.1 viruses.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The data included in Fig. 1 seem much more limited than what is currently available from sequence databases and include very few strains from 2007 and later. What is the amino acid at PB2 position 526 for the 107 human isolates and 101 avian isolates currently available from GISAID? The lack of information about PB2 526 in recent viruses makes it harder to translate the results from this study into actions. Additional phylogenetic analyses on PB2 526R/K in recent strains is needed to make this work relevant to the suggestion of the authors that PB2 position 526 should be screened to identify viruses with zoonotic potential.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The human isolates with PB2 526R are in a different clade than most of the avian viruses with PB2 K526R. What are the genetic changes responsible for this difference. Also, the authors should exclude that the important phylogenetic differences (526R vs 526K, and human 526R vs avian 526R) are due to differences in the way that these viruses were propagated (eggs, MDCKs, MDCK-SIAT1, etc)?",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "The authors associate the higher number of human infections in Indonesia with PB2 526R. This association requires an analysis of PB2 526R in other H5N1 clades than 2.1 to show that 526R is indeed absent/rare in regions where the number of human cases is lower than in Indonesia.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "Line 313: \u201c[\u2026], these results clearly show that K526R substitution in PB2 significantly enhances virus replication in mammalian cells, [\u2026]\u201d. This line should state that the K526R substitution enhances replication in the cells used in the experiments described in this manuscript.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "Line 332: \u201c[\u2026], supporting the idea that the K526R substitution is critical for infection of mice with Indonesian H5N1 viruses\u201d. This statement is not correct. As shown in Fig. 6C 526K viruses do replicate in mice. Please adjust to state that 526R enhances replication.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.7": "Line 379: \u201c[\u2026], which suggests that 526R PB2 has no fitness cost [\u2026]. Fitness costs may be very subtle and hard to measure. Therefore, the results of the analysis done for this manuscript do not show that 526R PB2 has no fitness cost, but merely that a fitness cost was not detected with the method used here. Please adjust the text accordingly.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.8": "Line 384: I think the conclusion from line 384 is an overinterpretation of the results from this work and should be rephrased. Suggest to change to: Taken together, these results indicate that host adaptive mutations in the PB2 gene enhance H5N1 virus replication in mice and that K526R PB2 is a pre-existing adaptive marker present in Indonesian H5N1 viruses currently circulating in avian species which supports increased virus replication in mammalian cells.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.9": "Line 426: The authors state that \u201c[\u2026], the K526R PB2 substitution in Indonesian H5N1 viruses is rarely associated with either E627K or D701N\u201d, which is not supported by data provided in the manuscript. A more extensive and updated phylogenetic analysis like suggested above could support this statement.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.10": "It is surprising that the analysis from Fig. 7 was performed only in A549 as representative for mammalian cells, and not in MDCKs like was done for the analysis in from Fig. 3. Please clarify this choice.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.11": "Line 441: replace indicate by suggest.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.12": "Line 81: \u201c[\u2026], it seems possible that for the genetic constellation of Indonesian H5N1 viruses optimal function of the polymerase complex for virus replication is independent of E627K, and instead requires K526R adaptive substitution\u201d. There is no indication that K526R is required as an adaptive solution, there may be other adaptive markers that happened to not get selected during evolution. Change requires to utilizes.",

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "Figure 2. What exactly is the origin of the PB1, PA and NP subunits of the polymerase, IND5 or CK2A? (see also remark for lines 427-443 and to Fig 8).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "In Figure 4A, there is some ambiguity about the values and the y-scale. To remove that ambiguity, and for the sake of readability, values (not their log10) should be reported, and the log10 y-scale should be emphasized by its subdivisions [2-9] between powers of 10. Same remark for Fig 6C.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "Lines 286-87. Between \u201cWe tested\u2026\u201d and \u201cOur results show\u2026\u201d, a sentence should explain the rationale of the test being used (what is the rationale of adding increasing amounts of NEP?). This would also help in understanding the data (lines 288-92). Same remark for the PB2-NP interaction (lines 292-95). In brief, how NEP and NP could be expected to modulate the activity of the viral polymerase? Further, these possible interactions with NEP and NP are not discussed at all (neither here nor in the discussion section).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Line 327 and Table 1. Contradictory data. \u201cmice infected with 10^3 PFU of the avian isolate CK2A showed no disease symptoms\u201d, while according to Table 1, the MLD50 of CK2A is 2.2 x 10^3 PFU. Same inconsistency for CK2A-526R (all mice survived with an inoculum of 10^3, but MLD50 is 2.2x 10^3). Moreover, according to the legend to Table 1, MLD50 were calculated after inoculating mice with 10^2 to 10^6 PFU. With such a protocol, it is impossible to reliably calculate an MLD50 below 10^3.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Fig 7E is somewhat misleading, in that one may understand that there is a competition between four viruses (526 R or K and 627 E or K). It would be better to put the name of the two viruses in front of the nucleotide sequence (CK2A-526R in front of AGA [R] ..GAG [E], and CK2A-627K in front of the line below. The data show that the latter \u201cwins\u201d the competition. The legend also is misleading.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "Line 417-18 should read \u201c..mixed populations of [526R-627E] and [526K-627K]\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "Line 383\u2026 rather \u201cComparisons of the two CK2A-derived viruses (i.e. [526R-627E] and [526K-627K]) through either virus growth kinetics or competition assays suggested that the E627K substitution had a greater positive effect on the replication potential in A549 cells than the K526R substitution\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.8": "Lines 427-443, 117-119 and 109-110. The available nucleotide sequences of the CK2A virus are only partial, precluding full-length alignments. Nevertheless, comparison of the available PB2 sequences shows another substitution (G669V) between IND5 and CK2A. Furthermore, comparison of the other polymerase subunit sequences reveals at least 2 substitutions between the PB1s and 4 substitutions between the PAs. But in fact sometimes it is difficult to find the precise information about the composition of the polymerase complex in the minireplicon assays (what is the origin of the PB1, PA and NP subunits, IND5 or CK2A?). More specifically for lines 427-443 and Fig. 8: since there are other substitutions (not only in PB2, but also in PB1 and PA) between IND5 and CK2A that could subtly alter the activity of the polymerase, it is necessary to know the relative efficiency of the two polymerase complexes (IND5 and CK2A). To this end, Graphs A and B in Fig. 8 should be combined in a unique graph, with the 100% value assigned to IND5-wt (otherwise, the activity of the wt-CK2A RNP relative to that of IND5 could be added in Fig 8A). Maybe a logarithmic y-scale (log2 or log10) could help to clearly see the differences between the conditions.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.9": "Lines 441-43. It is somewhat excessive to assign the difference of polymerase activity solely to the two PB2 substitutions R288Q and K526R, since (i) all the substitutions were not assayed and (ii) other substitutions in PB1 and PA may also play a role.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.10": "Lines 535-39. Perhaps a sentence could be added with the meaning that there is more than one unique pathway of adaptation to mammals for the viral polymerase, since at least two substitutions [PB2-K526R and PB2-E627K] have now been identified that prime these viruses for infecting human; with the added information that K526R does not negatively impact the viral replication in avian cells. Perhaps the authors should try to map the substitutions in the structure of the viral polymerase (cf Pflug 2014, Pflug 2018), at least to the main structural domains of PB2.",

      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "As for Figure 4A and 6C, the authors probably misunderstood my remark. In fact the first version of these figures was OK with the y-scale representing powers of ten. I simply suggested to add minor ticks representing the subdivisions 2 to 9 between powers of ten, so as to emphasize the logarithmic scale (in GraphPad, just click on menu \u201cformat axes\u201d and chose \u201cminor ticks\u201d).",
