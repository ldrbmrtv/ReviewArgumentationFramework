Reviewer 1;Author;1;1;0;Some FT-IR peaks shift with adsorption of Cr, and some not. Please add the discussion which peak shift is related to Cr, the authors can combine these with the discussion of the mechanism.
Reviewer 1;Author;1;2;0;The porosity of the sample should be measured.
Reviewer 1;Author;1;3;0;It is better to show the SEM images using the same scale. The magnified images can be shown separately or as inset.
Reviewer 1;Author;1;4;0;In Figure 3, what is the origin of the increase concentration of Al and S?
Reviewer 1;Author;1;5;0;In the experiment, H2SO4 is added in the first step, what is the purpose? Will this bring pollution problem?
Reviewer 1;Author;1;6;0;How about the Cr concentration in the polluted ground water? Is the products suitable for this real condition?
Reviewer 2;Author;1;1;0;The issue of regeneration has not been sufficiently worked out, but the authors themselves write about this, and it is not clear why NaOH was used for this.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;2;0;It was also not clear to me how much hydrochloric acid was eventually added during the preparation of the adsorbent.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;3;0;The authors did not indicate how the “separation factor ‘RL’ is calculated and did not give a link to the equation for its calculation, and if the readers are not quite in the subject, then what kind of factor they do not understand.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;4;0;One could also estimate the specific surface area and porosity. So, the paper can be published after revision.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;1;0;The authors should write the complete terms of all abbreviations (including the instruments) before the first use in the abstract and main manuscript i.e. FT-IR and SEM in abstract section et al.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;2;0;The authors should clearly explain the innovation and importance of their work on the introduction of the manuscript. They should justify the value of the work and compare their work with previously similar published papers.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;3;0;Fig. 1 - for a more effective visual comparison, authors recommended to provide SEM images of the same scale. In such form is rather difficult to make adequate comparison.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;4;0;EDX analysis (Fig 3) - a very conditional (not specific) type of analysis of the chemical composition of the surface. Often, spectra with different atomic abundances of elements can be obtained even from the same sample. First of all, authors have to attach a EDX mapping images before/after sorption of chromium ions. And the authors are strongly recommended to add XPS spectra to this section of revised manuscript. The XPS method is much more sensitive and more accurately determines changes in the chemical composition of samples.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;5;0;Why authors did not use XRD technique for sample characterization?
Reviewer 3;Author;1;6;0;The adsorption capacities of Al-GNSC adsorbents at different contact times have been provided. Which kinetics are right? Please add missing information about appropriate kinetic model in revised manuscript.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;7;0;It is rather difficult to make an adequate comparison of certain properties (catalysts or sorbents) with the already available results, since the concentration of the pollutant and the mass of the loaded sorbent vary in each experiment. Therefore, the authors are recommended to add the missing information (i.e. conditions for testing sorbents of Cr(VI) ions) to Table 3.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;8;0;In order to confirm proposed mechanism of Cr(VI) adsorption (illustrated on the fig 6) Authors should provide data on adsorption capacity of pristine groundnut shell activated carbon (not modified with Al).
Reviewer 3;Author;1;9;0;The conclusion section should be elaborated and improved. The author should bring specific conclusions in accordance with obtained results.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;10;0;Moderate English changes required
Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. According to the reviewer suggestion, FT-IR peaks shift related to chromium ion adsorption are discussed in the mechanism section and is incorporated in the revised manuscript. Thank you for your valuable suggestion.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;2;2;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. However, we regret that we were not able to investigate the BET analysis due to pandemic situation, which could definitely give us additional information. We hope the reviewer understand the experimental deficiencies at the stage of the present experiments. We deeply appreciate the comment raised by the reviewer. Thank you very much.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;3;3;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. According to the reviewer suggestion, the SEM images with same scale are provided in the revised manuscript. Thank you for your valuable suggestion.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;4;4;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. EDX analysis (In Figure 3) – is a conditional type of analysis of the chemical composition of the surface. In EDX, often, spectra with different atomic abundances of elements can be obtained even from the same sample. Thank you for your valuable suggestion.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;5;5;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. The sulphuric acid disintegrated the leaves. Most of the substances in the leaves are reduced to carbon after two hours. Charring takes place by adding sulphuric acid and by the action of heat, charring removes hydrogen and oxygen from the solid, so that the remaining char is composed primarily of carbon. It also helps to remove the moist content in the leaves. The pollution problem may not be takes place. Thank you for your valuable suggestion.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;6;6;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. Chromium is a potentially toxic metal occurring in water and groundwater as a result of natural and anthropogenic sources. The prepared adsorbent is well suitable in the real condition. Since the prepared adsorbent (Al-GNSC) is successfully reduces the chromium (VI) ion form the real groundwater samples. Thank you for your valuable suggestion.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. Based on the reviewer suggestion, regeneration studies were performed briefly. Four different desorption agents such as tap water, 0.1M HCl, 0.1M H2SO4 and 0.1M NaOH were utilized to remove the adsorbed chromium ions from the Al-GNSC adsorbent. From this various desorption agents it was identified that 0.1M NaOH was more effective. Hence, the reuse of Al-GNSC from Cr(VI)-loaded material was studied for sorption and desorption cycles using sodium hydroxide as a regenerated agent. Thank you for your valuable suggestion.

Author;Reviewer 2;2;2;2;We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion. For the preparation of 1kg of Al-GNSC adsorbent, approximately 150 to 200 mL of hydrochloric acid was added in order to blend the aluminum in to the ground nut shell carbon. Thank you for your valuable comment.
