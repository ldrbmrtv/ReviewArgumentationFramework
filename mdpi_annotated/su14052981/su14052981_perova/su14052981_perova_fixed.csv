Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;The abstract is very confusingly written and needs a lot of editing. This is the place where the story must be told as simply and clearly as possible, and I think a lot of the abstract is confusing and hard to interpret.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;I have some theoretical questions about the applicability of these approaches outside of Korea. For technical reasons (most smart cities have less capability and are less developed than Korean ones), but especially for legal and normative reasons (concerns about surveillance, governance, cybersecurity, etc.) I think many cities and countries will not be comfortable with this approach. I think this needs some exploration.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;I'd argue that one of the areas in which Smart City applications (in particular) and urban automation (in general) have been most important during the COVID pandemic - the monitoring of sewage and wastewater for population level assessment of infection - isn't even mentioned. I think that is both a big oversight, and an opportunity for critics. I think that piece needs to be included and worked into any assessment of smart cities and pandemics. Additionally, I've included a few other pieces on COVID and smart cities.
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;"“Additionally, smart city services couldn`t respond in-time series” (is this time series in the
 statistical sense? Just meaning sequential?)"

 pandemic situations: 18 the healthcare-system data consists of personal information. Therefore,
 smart city services respond- 19 ing COVID-19 must exist as a flexible.”"
Reviewer_1;Author;1;7;0;"pg2) Does the use of police/telecom monitoring of patients translate out of the Korean context?
 (i.e. would it be constrained by laws and norms elsewhere?) And what are the implications of this."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;8;0;"(pg3) Tables 1 is interesting, but it’s not clear the source of the data. Is this from the literature?
 (if so, needs sourcing), or a synthesis by the authors? This may be because of the error message

Reviewer_1;Author;1;9;0;(pg4) Table 3 isn’t clear to me. What is “EA”? Not spelled out

 service is no longer needed.” Is this likely to happen? Are there concrete examples of such
 systems being built and operated, then just turned off? Who would oppose turning them off? (I’d
 imagine many stakeholders)"
Reviewer_1;Author;1;12;0;Smart City and COVID
Reviewer_1;Author;1;13;0;Monitoring of sewage/wastewater for COVID case estimation
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;"This article advocates for better flexibility (in the sense of adding and removing when necessary)
 of smart city services and better integration between them. The authors argue that this would be
 precious to predict and fight against a pandemic, and as such they propose a smart city structure
 model. First, I have a series of concerns regarding the form. There are some phrasing issues and
 typos throughout the paper."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;"There are also many in-text reference errors with tables, which makes it hard to follow given the
 high number of tables (13!). Also, references to figures seem to include the full caption and cause
 line breaks instead of the figure number only. Please check especially the conclusion, this is
 hardly readable."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;"There are referencing issues with sections as well (e.g. line 213: “As mentioned in 0”) Finally,
 and most importantly, the format of the bibliography is highly problematic. For many references
 (e.g. [15], [22], [25]) it is impossible to retrieve the source. For many other sources, the local
 access path of the file is provided, which again prevents the reader from retrieving the source. All
 these issues could have been picked up by a simple check. Unfortunately, they are enough for me
 to recommend to reject the paper, as I consider that submitting a report of scientific quality in
 this form is unacceptable."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;"The content of the paper raises major concerns as well. In the introduction, I could not understand
 the motivation of the paper. The authors argue that the smart city services failed to be flexible
 enough to predict and fight the pandemic. However, I am lacking a concrete example of failure
 that proves the authors’ point. It is well-known that different services are hard to integrate
 together (this is not specific to the smart city), but I would have liked the authors to illustrate in
 2
 light of the pandemic context, and maybe to the context of Korea since their contribution is
 specific to this geographic context in that it integrates the 12 smart city categories of Korea and
 the healthcare phases of Korea. The contribution is not presented in the introduction, only the
 problem is."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;5;0;"The literature review is very long (it represents half of the paper) and can be significantly
 shortened as it contains few information that is actually useful to the rest of the paper. It is also
 hard to read, as it contains more tabular content than text. In Table 3, what is an EA?"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;6;0;"Table 4 presents smart city projects of several different countries. The authors than write that hese
 services have a limitation in that cannot predict and prevent transmission of threats such as
 COVID. It the threats concern COVID only, it does not really make sense, as many of the
 mentioned services simply do not have this goal (e.g. smart grid). If it goes beyond COVID, this
 is a claim that needs to be backed with a sound and transparent evaluation by the authors or
 literature."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;7;0;"Table 5 is useless in my opinion. It is well-known that many standards exist and are not used in
 every service, which causes integration issues. The authors could remove the table and mention
 1-2 standards relevant for pandemics and make the same point."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;8;0;Section 2.3 has the same title as Section 2.2.
Reviewer_2;Author;1;9;0;"It presents phased plans for pandemics. Several different plans are described, which is useless
 information for the reader. Indeed, the phases in a Texan county are of no use to understand the
 authors’ contribution. They could easily break the section down to the essential information that
 would be the WHO phases and the Korean healthcare phases, and mention that there are global
 and local plans throughout the world with different phases. Tables 8 and 9 can thus be removed.
 Table 7 is not very informative, all the phases say that actions from the previous phase should be
 continued or initiated. I have checked the online source and it mentions other aspects such as
 treatment and isolation for the recognition phase, which have not been picked up by the authors.
 A case study approach restricted to Korea would be more informative and more consistent with
 the contribution of the paper, which is as I mentioned specific to Korea."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;10;0;"Section 3, named “Main discussion”, should be renamed to be more explicit regarding what the
 reader can expect to find. I suggest e.g. “Revised model of smart city service structure”."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;11;0;"The contribution is a proposition of services such as screening people with thermal cameras and
 tracking infected people through CCTV. However, it misses a critical point of COVID. Infected
 people are in the public space without knowing that they have COVID, since contagion happens
 before symptoms appears. Once infected people have been identified, they are supposedly in
 quarantine. Do the authors propose to track everyone and then go back to the records of infected
 people to retrieve their paths and contacts? Or do the authors want to check if infected people
 are outside their home instead of in quarantine? This is not clear to me. Also, and more
 importantly, the integration and flexibility aspects are not really addressed in the end. The
 authors do not explain how the services they propose could be integrated with existing ones (e.g.
 which standards should be used) and how the services can be added or removed. This part is only
 represented as clouds in the proposed structure model but not discussed further. Therefore, it
 seems that the contribution breaks down to proposing strict tracking services which feasibility
 and acceptance by the population is not assessed."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;12;0;"My last concern is the ethical aspects of the proposed services. The authors acknowledge that
 not addressing these is a limitation of their research. In my opinion, this is more than a limitation,
 this is essential to discuss given the nature of what the authors propose."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;13;0;"In summary, my suggestions are to focus the paper on the Korean context, in an in-depth case
 study approach where authors detail more their contribution, clearly illustrate what the problem
 is and how their contribution helps solving it."

Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;"The confusingly written part has been simplified again. In addition, in order to solve the problem
 of awkward English, we have re-translated the entire sentence."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;2;2;"As your comments, Korea's smart city has technological and normative advances compared to
 other countries. However, we think that the USA and China are more developed in service than
 Korea`s (Smart city trends: A focus on 5 countries and 15 companies, Cities, 2022). Therefore,
 this paper intends to cover only general smart city technologies worldwide (Smart city trends: A
 focus on 5 countries and 15 companies, Cities 2022). We fully agree with the reviewer's
 comments that they may feel uncomfortable in other countries. After that, we will do more
 research and expand the case to other countries. Thank you very much for your comments"
Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"In this paper, the monitoring of sewage and wastewater for population level assessment of
 infection mentioned in smart city applications and urban automation was added as a limitation of
 this study. In the opinion of reviewers, epidemics in cities are not simply spread by one factor.
 Therefore, various factors should be dealt with, but in this paper, only heat and movement lines,
 which were mainly dealt with in Korea. The added part is as follows."
Author;Reviewer_1;2;4;4;Additionally, smart city services could respond neither timely nor sequentially.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;5;5;"This study proposes a method for timely and sequential responses, through a flexible
 combination of the healthcare system and smart city services"
Author;Reviewer_1;2;6;6;"Second, recommendations on combining or dismissing certain smart city services, as per the
 needs of coping with COVID-19, are summarized. Third, smart city services must be utilized
 only for addressing pandemics, as data from the healthcare system consists of personal
 information. Therefore, smart city services for responding to COVID-19 must be flexible"
Author;Reviewer_1;2;7;7;"In the case of Korea, rather than finding the infected person in advance, the focus was on
 identifying and blocking the spread of the infected person. Therefore, Smart City Service checked
 the movement of the infected people by time, found close contacts in the vicinity, and took
 measures to self-quarantine immediately. As a result, the critical point of being identified before
 an infectious disease spreads was missed. However, Korea has prevented a rapid collapse of the
 medical system by slowing the rate of propagation around it, and the role of smart city services
 has been significant in this regard."

Author;Reviewer_1;2;10;10;Thanks for your kind comments
Author;Reviewer_1;2;11;11;"We also agree with reviewers that it's an ideal situation to use built-in services only when needed
 and turn them off when not needed. Therefore, in Korea, it is legally required to be used only
 when necessary.
 Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport(Korea): “…… But the scope of data
 collected will be kept to minimum and a due procedure should be followed in acquiring the
 data. First, an epidemiological surveyor should decide whether additional collection of
 personal information is needed. If the answer is yes, the official should seek approval from
 relevant authorities to get access to the data. For example, as for the location information,
 separate permission from the National Police Agency is required.”"

Author;Reviewer_2;2;17;4;"We fully agree with the reviewer's comment that integration between services is difficult not only
 in smart cities but also in other fields. As advised by the reviewer, the situation in Korea was
 described in Figure 5 (Outbreak of COVID-19 in Korea and the limitations of smart city services)
 and Table 10 (Limitations of smart city services in each phase). The spread of COVID cannot
 simply be blocked by smart city services, but by simplifying the current state and proceeding
 with the thesis, we did not reflect Korea's medical stage with geographic characteristics. We will
 conduct additional research in the future to fully reflect the reviewer's comments. Thanks for the
 advice."

Author;Reviewer_2;2;23;10;"Thanks for the reviewer's comments. The title of this section 3 has been changed according to the
 comments of the reviewers."
Author;Reviewer_2;2;24;11;"We agree with the reviewers' opinion that the biggest cause of this COVID-19 transmission is the
 rapid spread of infected people around them by moving to public places before they show
 symptoms. In the case of Korea, rather than finding the infected person in advance, the focus was
 on identifying and blocking the spread of the infected person. Therefore, Smart City Service
 checked the movement of the infected people by time, found close contacts in the vicinity, and
 took measures to self-quarantine immediately. As a result, the critical point of being identified

 the ethical aspect was first specified, and in the situation where the service is not needed, the
 service is deleted in consideration of the ethical aspect in the structure of the smart city. Also in
 Korea, it is legally required to be used only when necessary."
Author;Reviewer_2;2;26;13;"Many revisions have been made to this paper according to the reviewer's comments. Although

 make a contribution to the literature in a way that the previous version may not have been able
 to"
Reviewer_1;Author;3;2;0;"I think mentioning the scenario approach in the abstract might be worthwhile, but I don't think
 it's a huge problem if it isn't mentioned. Either way, I think the paper is in much better shape."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;1;0;"The authors made substantial efforts to take my comments into account, and I commend them for
 that. However, despite the good improvements, I have some remaining concerns"
Reviewer_2;Author;3;2;0;"There are still some ""Reference not found"" errors and line breaks when referring to figures in the
 text, but almost everything regarding the format has been fixed, which gives the revised paper a
 much more professional look than its previous version. Regarding the references, my point was
 that there are many references *with formatting mistakes in them*, and not that there are too
 many references in the bibliography. Please feel free to add them back if you feel they should be
 included."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;3;0;"The motivation of the paper is still unclear for me in the introduction, and the reasons for the
 limitations of smart city services are not clear in Section 2, but is much better explained later in
 the paper, which is a nice improvement. I believe that explaining standard constraints (due to the
 multiplicity of service providers) and coupling between services in the introduction to motivate
 the paper would be valuable. Indeed, if my understanding is correct, they are the factors that
 cause the limitations of smart city services the authors want to address."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;4;0;"The authors made some efforts to streamline Section 2, and it is much easier to follow in its current
 form. However, some parts still appear unnecessary to me. Table 3 just shows that medical, crime
 prevention, transportation, and environmental services are the most frequent, which is already
 said in the text, but without an explanation of what pilot city, regulatory sandbox, and smart city
 2
 challenge are, it is difficult to extract anything else from this table. Table 7 does not bring much
 useful insights as well in its current form. The authors have not responded to my previous
 comment on this table, I thus redirect them to my review of the previous version."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;5;0;"Section 3.1 gives an overview of the COVID-19 and smart city systems situation in South Korea,
 but is not part of the novel contribution by the authors. I would thus include it in Section 2 instead.
 Section 2 would thus have a part on smart city services, a part on COVID-19 response plans, and
 then the current content of 3.1 which deals with the relationship between the two parts of the
 current Section 2. It would allow a smoother transition between Section 2 and Section 3, as the
 modified Section 2 would conclude with the need for a novel smart city service structure."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;6;0;"From the additional explanations in the text, I understand that the idea is to track the movements
 of everyone and then use that information to trace back the contacts of confirmed infected patients.
 I stand by my position that the feasibility/ethical aspects should be discussed, at least from a
 social acceptance or a legal point of view, as the reader is left skeptical about whether it can
 actually be done with the current explanations. The authors bring up interesting legal
 considerations in their response to my comments, it would be nice to have them in the paper to
 show the reader under which conditions the authors' solution can be used."
Reviewer_2;Author;3;7;0;"Finally, and this is my biggest remaining concern, the authors have not responded to my comment
 regarding the lack of explanations on how the flexible adding and removal of the proposed
 services would be achieved. This is still unclear to me in the paper. This is a very important point,
 since it changes what is the contribution of the paper. The current contribution seems to be the
 proposal of new services to handle the COVID situation, or similar situations in the future.
 However, I am lacking the contribution on the more general issue of integrating and removing
 services in an existing smart city infrastructure. In other terms, what can we use from the authors'
 paper to achieve a more flexible smart city service structure?"
Reviewer_2;Author;3;8;0;"In brief, the authors have made major improvements on the form and good improvements to the
 content. However, there are still several of my previous comments that were not answered or not
 answered in a sufficiently convincing way."
Author;Reviewer_1;4;1;1;"Thanks for your kind words. The quality of the paper has improved on the reviewer's advice.

 City Challenge are in progress. To summarize the smart city services used in this project, medical,

 for your comments"
Author;Reviewer_2;4;7;5;"As commented by reviewer, the content of Section 3.1 includes the content of Section 2. However,
 for the 3.2 Expansion of smart city structure that we want to present, I think it is necessary to
 organize the contents of Section 2 through Section 3.1 and to draw limitations. Of course, it is
 also correct to understand the structure as the opinions of reviewer. We put a lot of thought into
 reflecting the opinions. We are sorry; however, we have decided that it is difficult to change the
 structure at the moment. We ask for your generous understanding of the current structure. Thank
 you."

 concept for the smart city structure to cope with major situations such as COVID-19. Therefore,
 it was not possible to present a specific method of adding or removing a smart city system.
 Currently, smart city services in Korea are trying to implement a structure that adds and deletes
 when necessary, as in this paper (Reference #73). However, we apologize for not being able to
 give you a clear answer on this question. After observing the process of implementing the system,
 we will present a specific method in the thesis we plan to proceed later."
