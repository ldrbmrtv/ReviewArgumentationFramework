      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "I have some theoretical questions about the applicability of these approaches outside of Korea. For technical reasons (most smart cities have less capability and are less developed than Korean ones), but especially for legal and normative reasons (concerns about surveillance, governance, cybersecurity, etc.) I think many cities and countries will not be comfortable with this approach. I think this needs some exploration.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "I'd argue that one of the areas in which Smart City applications (in particular) and urban automation (in general) have been most important during the COVID pandemic - the monitoring of sewage and wastewater for population level assessment of infection - isn't even mentioned. I think that is both a big oversight, and an opportunity for critics. I think that piece needs to be included and worked into any assessment of smart cities and pandemics. Additionally, I've included a few other pieces on COVID and smart cities.",

    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "This article advocates for better flexibility (in the sense of adding and removing when necessary)\r\n of smart city services and better integration between them. The authors argue that this would be\r\n precious to predict and fight against a pandemic, and as such they propose a smart city structure\r\n model. First, I have a series of concerns regarding the form. There are some phrasing issues and\r\n typos throughout the paper.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "There are also many in-text reference errors with tables, which makes it hard to follow given the\r\n high number of tables (13!). Also, references to figures seem to include the full caption and cause\r\n line breaks instead of the figure number only. Please check especially the conclusion, this is\r\n hardly readable.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "There are referencing issues with sections as well (e.g. line 213: \u201cAs mentioned in 0\u201d) Finally,\r\n and most importantly, the format of the bibliography is highly problematic. For many references\r\n (e.g. [15], [22], [25]) it is impossible to retrieve the source. For many other sources, the local\r\n access path of the file is provided, which again prevents the reader from retrieving the source. All\r\n these issues could have been picked up by a simple check. Unfortunately, they are enough for me\r\n to recommend to reject the paper, as I consider that submitting a report of scientific quality in\r\n this form is unacceptable.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "The content of the paper raises major concerns as well. In the introduction, I could not understand\r\n the motivation of the paper. The authors argue that the smart city services failed to be flexible\r\n enough to predict and fight the pandemic. However, I am lacking a concrete example of failure\r\n that proves the authors\u2019 point. It is well-known that different services are hard to integrate\r\n together (this is not specific to the smart city), but I would have liked the authors to illustrate in\r\n 2\r\n light of the pandemic context, and maybe to the context of Korea since their contribution is\r\n specific to this geographic context in that it integrates the 12 smart city categories of Korea and\r\n the healthcare phases of Korea. The contribution is not presented in the introduction, only the\r\n problem is.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "The literature review is very long (it represents half of the paper) and can be significantly\r\n shortened as it contains few information that is actually useful to the rest of the paper. It is also\r\n hard to read, as it contains more tabular content than text. In Table 3, what is an EA?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "Table 4 presents smart city projects of several different countries. The authors than write that hese\r\n services have a limitation in that cannot predict and prevent transmission of threats such as\r\n COVID. It the threats concern COVID only, it does not really make sense, as many of the\r\n mentioned services simply do not have this goal (e.g. smart grid). If it goes beyond COVID, this\r\n is a claim that needs to be backed with a sound and transparent evaluation by the authors or\r\n literature.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "Table 5 is useless in my opinion. It is well-known that many standards exist and are not used in\r\n every service, which causes integration issues. The authors could remove the table and mention\r\n 1-2 standards relevant for pandemics and make the same point.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.8": "Section 2.3 has the same title as Section 2.2.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.9": "It presents phased plans for pandemics. Several different plans are described, which is useless\r\n information for the reader. Indeed, the phases in a Texan county are of no use to understand the\r\n authors\u2019 contribution. They could easily break the section down to the essential information that\r\n would be the WHO phases and the Korean healthcare phases, and mention that there are global\r\n and local plans throughout the world with different phases. Tables 8 and 9 can thus be removed.\r\n Table 7 is not very informative, all the phases say that actions from the previous phase should be\r\n continued or initiated. I have checked the online source and it mentions other aspects such as\r\n treatment and isolation for the recognition phase, which have not been picked up by the authors.\r\n A case study approach restricted to Korea would be more informative and more consistent with\r\n the contribution of the paper, which is as I mentioned specific to Korea.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.10": "Section 3, named \u201cMain discussion\u201d, should be renamed to be more explicit regarding what the\r\n reader can expect to find. I suggest e.g. \u201cRevised model of smart city service structure\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.11": "The contribution is a proposition of services such as screening people with thermal cameras and\r\n tracking infected people through CCTV. However, it misses a critical point of COVID. Infected\r\n people are in the public space without knowing that they have COVID, since contagion happens\r\n before symptoms appears. Once infected people have been identified, they are supposedly in\r\n quarantine. Do the authors propose to track everyone and then go back to the records of infected\r\n people to retrieve their paths and contacts? Or do the authors want to check if infected people\r\n are outside their home instead of in quarantine? This is not clear to me. Also, and more\r\n importantly, the integration and flexibility aspects are not really addressed in the end. The\r\n authors do not explain how the services they propose could be integrated with existing ones (e.g.\r\n which standards should be used) and how the services can be added or removed. This part is only\r\n represented as clouds in the proposed structure model but not discussed further. Therefore, it\r\n seems that the contribution breaks down to proposing strict tracking services which feasibility\r\n and acceptance by the population is not assessed.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.12": "My last concern is the ethical aspects of the proposed services. The authors acknowledge that\r\n not addressing these is a limitation of their research. In my opinion, this is more than a limitation,\r\n this is essential to discuss given the nature of what the authors propose.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.13": "In summary, my suggestions are to focus the paper on the Korean context, in an in-depth case\r\n study approach where authors detail more their contribution, clearly illustrate what the problem\r\n is and how their contribution helps solving it.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "The authors made substantial efforts to take my comments into account, and I commend them for\r\n that. However, despite the good improvements, I have some remaining concerns",
      "Reviewer_2.3.2": "There are still some \"Reference not found\" errors and line breaks when referring to figures in the\r\n text, but almost everything regarding the format has been fixed, which gives the revised paper a\r\n much more professional look than its previous version. Regarding the references, my point was\r\n that there are many references *with formatting mistakes in them*, and not that there are too\r\n many references in the bibliography. Please feel free to add them back if you feel they should be\r\n included.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.3": "The motivation of the paper is still unclear for me in the introduction, and the reasons for the\r\n limitations of smart city services are not clear in Section 2, but is much better explained later in\r\n the paper, which is a nice improvement. I believe that explaining standard constraints (due to the\r\n multiplicity of service providers) and coupling between services in the introduction to motivate\r\n the paper would be valuable. Indeed, if my understanding is correct, they are the factors that\r\n cause the limitations of smart city services the authors want to address.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.4": "The authors made some efforts to streamline Section 2, and it is much easier to follow in its current\r\n form. However, some parts still appear unnecessary to me. Table 3 just shows that medical, crime\r\n prevention, transportation, and environmental services are the most frequent, which is already\r\n said in the text, but without an explanation of what pilot city, regulatory sandbox, and smart city\r\n 2\r\n challenge are, it is difficult to extract anything else from this table. Table 7 does not bring much\r\n useful insights as well in its current form. The authors have not responded to my previous\r\n comment on this table, I thus redirect them to my review of the previous version.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.5": "Section 3.1 gives an overview of the COVID-19 and smart city systems situation in South Korea,\r\n but is not part of the novel contribution by the authors. I would thus include it in Section 2 instead.\r\n Section 2 would thus have a part on smart city services, a part on COVID-19 response plans, and\r\n then the current content of 3.1 which deals with the relationship between the two parts of the\r\n current Section 2. It would allow a smoother transition between Section 2 and Section 3, as the\r\n modified Section 2 would conclude with the need for a novel smart city service structure.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.6": "From the additional explanations in the text, I understand that the idea is to track the movements\r\n of everyone and then use that information to trace back the contacts of confirmed infected patients.\r\n I stand by my position that the feasibility/ethical aspects should be discussed, at least from a\r\n social acceptance or a legal point of view, as the reader is left skeptical about whether it can\r\n actually be done with the current explanations. The authors bring up interesting legal\r\n considerations in their response to my comments, it would be nice to have them in the paper to\r\n show the reader under which conditions the authors' solution can be used.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.7": "Finally, and this is my biggest remaining concern, the authors have not responded to my comment\r\n regarding the lack of explanations on how the flexible adding and removal of the proposed\r\n services would be achieved. This is still unclear to me in the paper. This is a very important point,\r\n since it changes what is the contribution of the paper. The current contribution seems to be the\r\n proposal of new services to handle the COVID situation, or similar situations in the future.\r\n However, I am lacking the contribution on the more general issue of integrating and removing\r\n services in an existing smart city infrastructure. In other terms, what can we use from the authors'\r\n paper to achieve a more flexible smart city service structure?",
      "Reviewer_2.3.8": "In brief, the authors have made major improvements on the form and good improvements to the\r\n content. However, there are still several of my previous comments that were not answered or not\r\n answered in a sufficiently convincing way."

We are sorry; however, we have decided that it is difficult to change the\r\n structure at the moment. We ask for your generous understanding of the current structure. Thank\r\n you.",
      "Author.4.8": "Thank you for understanding a little more about our paper. Also, I totally agree with the reviewer's\r\n comments about the skepticism of readers. Accordingly, the legal considerations specified in the\r\n first review have been added to the text. Its contents are as follows.",
      "Author.4.9": "We are sorry for not being clear on the answer to the last review. This paper tried to present a\r\n concept for the smart city structure to cope with major situations such as COVID-19. Therefore,\r\n it was not possible to present a specific method of adding or removing a smart city system.\r\n Currently, smart city services in Korea are trying to implement a structure that adds and deletes\r\n when necessary, as in this paper (Reference #73). However, we apologize for not being able to\r\n give you a clear answer on this question. After observing the process of implementing the system,\r\n we will present a specific method in the thesis we plan to proceed later.",
      "Author.4.10": "Many revisions have been made to this paper according to the reviewer's comments. Although\r\n there are still many things incomplete, we did our best to reflect the opinions of the reviewers.\r\n Also, we sincerely appreciate the accurate comments from the reviewers. In addition, we will use\r\n a more advanced paper by reflecting it in the ongoing research.",
