      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "I have some theoretical questions about the applicability of these approaches outside of Korea.  For technical reasons (most smart cities have less capability and are less developed than Korean ones), but especially for legal and normative reasons (concerns about surveillance, governance, cybersecurity, etc.) I think many cities and countries will not be comfortable with this approach.  I think this needs some exploration.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "I'd argue that one of the areas in which Smart City applications (in particular) and urban automation (in general) have been most important during the COVID pandemic - the monitoring of sewage and wastewater for population level assessment of infection - isn't even mentioned.  I think that is both a big oversight, and an opportunity for critics.  I think that piece needs to be included and worked into any assessment of smart cities and pandemics.  Additionally, I've included a few other pieces on COVID and smart cities.",

    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "This article advocates for better flexibility (in the sense of adding and removing when necessary)\nof smart city services and better integration between them. The authors argue that this would be \nprecious to predict and fight against a pandemic, and as such they propose a smart city structure \nmodel. First, I have a series of concerns regarding the form. There are some phrasing issues and \ntypos throughout the paper.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "There are also many in-text reference errors with tables, which makes it hard to follow given the \nhigh number of tables (13!). Also, references to figures seem to include the full caption and cause \nline breaks instead of the figure number only. Please check especially the conclusion, this is \nhardly readable.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "There are referencing issues with sections as well (e.g. line 213: \u201cAs mentioned in 0\u201d) Finally, \nand most importantly, the format of the bibliography is highly problematic. For many references \n(e.g. [15], [22], [25]) it is impossible to retrieve the source. For many other sources, the local \naccess path of the file is provided, which again prevents the reader from retrieving the source. All \nthese issues could have been picked up by a simple check. Unfortunately, they are enough for me \nto recommend to reject the paper, as I consider that submitting a report of scientific quality in \nthis form is unacceptable.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "The content of the paper raises major concerns as well. In the introduction, I could not understand \nthe motivation of the paper. The authors argue that the smart city services failed to be flexible \nenough to predict and fight the pandemic. However, I am lacking a concrete example of failure \nthat proves the authors\u2019 point. It is well-known that different services are hard to integrate \ntogether (this is not specific to the smart city), but I would have liked the authors to illustrate in light of the pandemic context, and maybe to the context of Korea since their contribution is \nspecific to this geographic context in that it integrates the 12 smart city categories of Korea and \nthe healthcare phases of Korea. The contribution is not presented in the introduction, only the \nproblem is.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "The literature review is very long (it represents half of the paper) and can be significantly \nshortened as it contains few information that is actually useful to the rest of the paper. It is also \nhard to read, as it contains more tabular content than text. In Table 3, what is an EA?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "Table 4 presents smart city projects of several different countries. The authors than write that hese \nservices have a limitation in that cannot predict and prevent transmission of threats such as \nCOVID. It the threats concern COVID only, it does not really make sense, as many of the \nmentioned services simply do not have this goal (e.g. smart grid). If it goes beyond COVID, this \nis a claim that needs to be backed with a sound and transparent evaluation by the authors or \nliterature.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.7": "Table 5 is useless in my opinion. It is well-known that many standards exist and are not used in \nevery service, which causes integration issues. The authors could remove the table and mention \n1-2 standards relevant for pandemics and make the same point.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.8": "Section 2.3 has the same title as Section 2.2.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.9": "It presents phased plans for pandemics. Several different plans are described, which is useless information for the reader. Indeed, the phases in a Texan county are of no use to understand the \nauthors\u2019 contribution. They could easily break the section down to the essential information that would be the WHO phases and the Korean healthcare phases, and mention that there are global \nand local plans throughout the world with different phases. Tables 8 and 9 can thus be removed. Table 7 is not very informative, all the phases say that actions from the previous phase should be \ncontinued or initiated. I have checked the online source and it mentions other aspects such as treatment and isolation for the recognition phase, which have not been picked up by the authors. \nA case study approach restricted to Korea would be more  informative and more consistent with the contribution of the paper, which is as I mentioned specific to Korea.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.10": "Section 3, named \u201cMain discussion\u201d, should be renamed to be more explicit regarding what the reader can expect to find. I suggest e.g. \u201cRevised model of smart city service structure\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.11": "The contribution is a proposition of services such as screening people with thermal cameras and tracking infected people through CCTV. However, it misses a critical point of COVID. Infected people are in the public space without knowing that they have COVID, since contagion happens before symptoms appears. Once infected people have been identified, they are supposedly in quarantine. Do the authors propose to track everyone and then go back to the records of infected \npeople to retrieve their paths and contacts? Or do the authors want to check if infected people are outside their home instead of in quarantine? This is not clear to me. Also, and more \nimportantly, the integration and flexibility aspects are not really addressed in the end. The authors do not explain how the services they propose could be integrated with existing ones (e.g. \nwhich standards should be used) and how the services can be added or removed. This part is only represented as clouds in the proposed structure model but not discussed further. Therefore, it \nseems that the contribution breaks down to proposing strict tracking services which feasibility and acceptance by the population is not assessed.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.12": "My last concern is the ethical aspects of the proposed services. The authors acknowledge that not addressing these is a limitation of their research. In my opinion, this is more than a limitation,\nthis is essential to discuss given the nature of what the authors propose.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.13": "In summary, my suggestions are to focus the paper on the Korean context, in an in-depth case study approach where authors detail more their contribution, clearly illustrate what the problem is and how their contribution helps solving it.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "The authors made substantial efforts to take my comments into account, and I commend them for \nthat. However, despite the good improvements, I have some remaining concerns.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.2": "There are still some \"Reference not found\" errors and line breaks when referring to figures in the \ntext, but almost everything regarding the format has been fixed, which gives the revised paper a \nmuch more professional look than its previous version. Regarding the references, my point was \nthat there are many references *with formatting mistakes in them*, and not that there are too \nmany references in the bibliography. Please feel free to add them back if you feel they should be \nincluded.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.3": "The motivation of the paper is still unclear for me in the introduction, and the reasons for the \nlimitations of smart city services are not clear in Section 2, but is much better explained later in \nthe paper, which is a nice improvement. I believe that explaining standard constraints (due to the \nmultiplicity of service providers) and coupling between services in the introduction to motivate \nthe paper would be valuable. Indeed, if my understanding is correct, they are the factors that \ncause the limitations of smart city services the authors want to address.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.4": "The authors made some efforts to streamline Section 2, and it is much easier to follow in its current \nform. However, some parts still appear unnecessary to me. Table 3 just shows that medical, crime \nprevention, transportation, and environmental services are the most frequent, which is already \nsaid in the text, but without an explanation of what pilot city, regulatory sandbox, and smart city challenge are, it is difficult to extract anything else from this table. Table 7 does not bring much \nuseful insights as well in its current form. The authors have not responded to my previous \ncomment on this table, I thus redirect them to my review of the previous version.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.5": "Section 3.1 gives an overview of the COVID-19 and smart city systems situation in South Korea, \nbut is not part of the novel contribution by the authors. I would thus include it in Section 2 instead. \nSection 2 would thus have a part on smart city services, a part on COVID-19 response plans, and \nthen the current content of 3.1 which deals with the relationship between the two parts of the \ncurrent Section 2. It would allow a smoother transition between Section 2 and Section 3, as the \nmodified Section 2 would conclude with the need for a novel smart city service structure.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.6": "From the additional explanations in the text, I understand that the idea is to track the movements \nof everyone and then use that information to trace back the contacts of confirmed infected patients. \nI stand by my position that the feasibility/ethical aspects should be discussed, at least from a \nsocial acceptance or a legal point of view, as the reader is left skeptical about whether it can \nactually be done with the current explanations. The authors bring up interesting legal \nconsiderations in their response to my comments, it would be nice to have them in the paper to \nshow the reader under which conditions the authors' solution can be used.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.7": "Finally, and this is my biggest remaining concern, the authors have not responded to my comment \nregarding the lack of explanations on how the flexible adding and removal of the proposed \nservices would be achieved. This is still unclear to me in the paper. This is a very important point, \nsince it changes what is the contribution of the paper. The current contribution seems to be the \nproposal of new services to handle the COVID situation, or similar situations in the future. \nHowever, I am lacking the contribution on the more general issue of integrating and removing \nservices in an existing smart city infrastructure. In other terms, what can we use from the authors' \npaper to achieve a more flexible smart city service structure?",
      "Reviewer_2.3.8": "In brief, the authors have made major improvements on the form and good improvements to the \ncontent. However, there are still several of my previous comments that were not answered or not \nanswered in a sufficiently convincing way."

Accordingly, the legal considerations specified in the \nfirst review have been added to the text. Its contents are as follows.  \u201c\u2026 In Korea, disease-related smart city services are legally sanctioned to be used only when \nnecessary to protect personal information.\u201d",
      "Author.4.9": "We are sorry for not being clear on the answer to the last review. This paper tried to present a \nconcept for the smart city structure to cope with major situations such as COVID-19. Therefore, \nit was not possible to present a specific method of adding or removing a smart city system. \nCurrently, smart city services in Korea are trying to implement a structure that adds and deletes \nwhen necessary, as in this paper (Reference #73). However, we apologize for not being able to \ngive you a clear answer on this question. After observing the process of implementing the system, \nwe will present a specific method in the thesis we plan to proceed later.",
      "Author.4.10": "Many revisions have been made to this paper according to the reviewer's comments. Although \nthere are still many things incomplete, we did our best to reflect the opinions of the reviewers. \nAlso, we sincerely appreciate the accurate comments from the reviewers. In addition, we will use \na more advanced paper by reflecting it in the ongoing research.",
