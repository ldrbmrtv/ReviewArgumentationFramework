Reviewer_1;Author;1;1;0;"However, the overall thrust in the paper is somewhat strange. After mechanically, without checking 
assumptions, doing specification test, checking the results carefully, etc. they conclude that relationships, 
which are not visible in graphs, cannot be found even with the most sophisticated approach. But who 
thinks they could, or should, be found? Tests are used to support informal results, such as those obtained 
in graphs."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;2;0;"I don’t really doubt the empirical findings of the paper (which I see as support for the hypothesis in 
Japan and possibly in Korea), but I dislike the approach of spending a lot of space on various, often 
pointless, tests. There should be one detailed analysis based on adequate tests, and a discussion about 
the results. After all, government expenditure is a political decision."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;3;0;"An import question is why are the series for real GDP per capita are taken from PWT 7.0? These 
series are constructed to be used in cross-country studies, and they are not suitable for the analyses in 
the paper. See the paper by Johnson et al. (2009)."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;4;0;"The dependency ratio has not been included mechanically in most papers, as it is this one. It is 
supposed to pick up changes in demand for government expenditure, such as schooling and pensions. 
The general idea is that these have increased government expenditure, both because per-capita schooling 
and pensions have expanded and because the dependency ratio has increased. In most of the countries 
studied, as is well-known, the dependency ratio declined during the period studied, while expenditure 
per person probably increased. Japan is most likely an exception; it should have entered the demographic 
transition much earlier than the other countries. There is thus no a priory no reason to expect the 
dependency ratio to play an important role in the Wagner hypothesis in general. It can thus be removed 
from the analysis, or moved to a footnote. If the author(s) wish to pursue the approach of testing other 
potentially relevant variables, see Shelton 2007."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;5;0;"Figure 1 tends to hide co-movements between the variables by mixing of scales. I suggest the graphs 
are re-done using two y-axes and preferably logs."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;6;0;The correlations in Table 4 are by definition not valid in the cases where the variables are nonstationary. Even high correlations are uninformative in this case. 
Reviewer_1;Author;1;7;0;"The static regressions in Table 5 are used when testing for cointegration (Engle-Granger approach), 
when the variables have a unit root. In these cases, correction for serial correlation (AR1) just messes 
up the results. And when the variables are stationary, the validity of AR1 should be tested."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;8;0;"In Table 5 we can get information about cointegration from the R2 and the t-values. Only Japan shows 
any promise, in all other cases R2 are very low. I would say they are suspiciously low for time series 
data. Are thy correct?"
Reviewer_1;Author;1;9;0;"The discussion about endogeneity can be skipped. In any case, cointegration analysis allows for 
endogeneity, and it can easily be test when there is cointegration. The instruments used (lags) are not 
useful since the variables are very persistent. And they should give the same results as OLS."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;10;0;"Unless short run dynamics are an important reason for the lack of cointegration, the Johansen test 
should give the same results as the static OLS regressions, when there is one cointegrating vector. The 
authors do not seem to understand they are using different approaches to test for cointegration."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;11;0;"The Johansen approach is suitable for times series with many observations, about 300. When one has 
fewer than 50, it is not possible to rely on the tests in the way it is done in the paper. Additional 
information has to be provided. See Juselius (2001) for an instructive example."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;12;0;"Gregory–Hansen is used when one fails to find cointegration with standard tests. There is no point in 
testing countries such as Japan and Korea, when a superior test shows that they are cointegrated."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;13;0;"The use of the MTAR model is dubious because of the small sample, and it should not be used when 
cointegration has been established. It is unlikely that there is enough information in the data to capture asymmetric effects and the standard procedure is to use MTAR when Engle-Granger fails to show 
cointegration."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;14;0;"What is the alternative hypothesis of the Pedroni test, that there is cointegration in any country or or 
in all countries? This should be made clear."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;15;0;"The authors provide a very provocative conclusion (see below), but it is not supported by the analyses 
in the paper."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;16;0;"The single-country analysis would provide the same results if done carefully, and the panel 
data analyses are dubious both because of the small cross-section (six) and the heterogeneity of the 
sample. I don’t mind the use panel analyses they can be presented for illustrative purposes, noting the 
heterogeneity. However, the time series analyses should be done correctly."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;17;0;"Moreover, it is quite obvious 
that in simple bivariate cases, graphs can be very informative."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;18;0;"However, the author(s) do not manage to 
provide any useful information about the dependency ratio in the ‘old fashioned’ analyses; they do only 
in Table 5 when (unknowingly) testing for cointegrating using OLS."
Reviewer_1;Author;1;19;0;"“Methodologically, while the pattern is reflected fairly well in plots and simple correlations, and even
in regressions, the widely-used cointegration methodology yields a diverse scenario in four different 
procedures, and, through a choice of the procedure and the model, it seems as easy to conclude that there 
is no cointegration, and thus no support for the hypothesis as to conclude that the evidence supports the 
hypothesis in a majority of the cases. At any rate, it is not obvious that such sophisticated and complex 
tests of cointegration provide any useful additional insight regarding the empirical status of the 
hypothesis. More generally, we venture the highly subjective view that despite the immense 
mathematical sophistication of cointegration tests and their application in perhaps thousands of studies, 
it is not obvious how much additional substantive insight has been gained in the wide variety of contexts 
in which these tests have been used.”
These statements should be explained. Is the second one a rejection of the last 40 years of advances 
in times series analysis?"
Reviewer_1;Author;1;20;0;"Despite Biehl’s (1998) insightful essay, almost all empirical research on the topic has interpreted the 
Wagnerian proposition"
Reviewer_1;Author;1;21;0;"As Ram (1998, Pp. 149-150) has explained, considerations of “nonstationarity” of the variables or 
“spuriousness” of the correlations or regression do not have much bearing on such tests."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;1;0;"List of references is scant and limited. It is necessary to add more recent works on the subject with 
alternative ways of testing for Wagner’s Law. Suggestions include “Testing the Validity of 
Wagner’s Law in Bolivia: A Cointegration and Causality Analysis with Disaggregated Data” by 
A. Bojanic (2013); “Wagner’s Law and Italian Disaggregated Public Spending: Some Empirical 
Evidences” by C. Magazzino (2010); and “Panel Data, Cointegration, Causality and Wagner’s 
Law: Empirical Evidence from Chinese Provinces” by Narayan, P.K., et al. (2008)."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;2;0;"The paper only lists one way of testing for Wagner’s hypothesis (i.e., analyzing the relation between the share on GDP of government spending and real GDP per capita) when in fact there 
are many ways of looking at the hypothesis. The authors should include at least a couple of recent 
ways of testing this law, in addition to the traditional way of testing for it."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;3;0;"The variables used do not have the same units, which may clog the analysis of the paper. 
Specifically, real GDP per capita is measured in 2005 dollars while the share of government 
consumption on GDP is measured in current prices. Either both should be in real terms or both in 
current prices, but not as is currently the case."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;4;0;"The descriptive stats in Table 2 reflect stats for the whole period? If so, the table should explicitly 
state this fact."
Reviewer_2;Author;1;5;0;"Why are there 3 graphs for the Philippines in Figure 1? By the way, if the variables were measured 
in either current prices or utilizing the same base year, these graphs would likely be quite different 
(same goes for all statistical analysis, it is likely to vary when the two variables are measured the 
same way)"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;6;0;"What is the point of the dependency rate? The authors should expand on the need to add this 
variable and what exactly is it trying to capture. In the same vein, what do the authors mean by 
“however, it seems that the fall in young-dependency ratio was greater than the rise in the olddependency rate” on p. 4?"
Reviewer_2;Author;1;7;0;In Table 4, delete the “generated by SAS” note.
Author;Reviewer_1;2;1;1;"Following the reviewer’s comments, we have now focused on one detailed analysis based on 
adequate tests and a discussion of the results. The revised version drops Descriptive statistics in old 
Table 2, rates of increase given in the old Table 3, correlations reported in old Table 4, the regressions 
in old Table 5, and pooled regressions of old Table 6. The discussion based on these Tables has 
consequently been omitted from the revision. The unit-root-test Tables have been moved from the 
Appendix to the text as Table 2, and in view of the evidence in favor of unit roots, rates of growth of GDP and government variables have been shown in Table 3 somewhat like the old Table 3. These are 
the most major changes."

Author;Reviewer_1;2;3;3;"The authors are aware of the Johnson et al. paper (JME 2013) and other critiques of the PWT data. 
However, while the LCU numbers are appropriate for single-country analysis, these are not suitable for 
panel-data format which is a significant part of this study. Therefore, we use the PWT numbers 
throughout and hope that single-country analysis with these numbers is a reasonable approximation to 
the scenario indicated by LCU data."

Author;Reviewer_2;2;23;3;"Real GDP per capita is a fairly standard proxy for the “level of development” in the context of 
Wagner’s hypothesis. It might not be appropriate to use nominal GDP per capita. For the government 
share, it seems better to take the current-price ratio which indicates what fraction of the current output 
is used for government activities. The deflators for GDP and government spending are different and 
“real” government-share may not be a good indicator of the resource-use by the government during the 
current year."

section based politics, the characteristics of the economies, etc."
Reviewer_1;Author;3;2;0;"The graphs in Figure 1 are still misleading, probably because of the scaling of the axes. It is obvious 
for Japan, where there is no discernible evidence for cointegration. With proper scaling, the lines should 
cross each other four times, providing some (but weak) evidence for cointegration."
