      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "This manuscript adds evidence that NR2F1 is a dormancy marker. In addition, it shows \nthat NR2F1 is primarily expressed in CAFs, particularly in inflammatory CAFs.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "Given that dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) highly express NR2F1 (Fluegel et al. Nat Cell Biol 2017), it is puzzling how NR2F1 in CAFs of the primary tumor would contribute to dormancy of DTCs. It would be nice, if the authors would discuss this important point in more detail.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "The authors choose chemotherapy as a treatment option to compare it with NR2F1 levels. It would be interesting to see, how NR2F1 levels would change with endocrine treatment and/or endocrine resistance.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease. Different subtypes behave differently in many aspects. It would be great to see some subtype-specific data.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "The authors state \u201cWe demonstrated that the expression of NR2F1, RARB, and TGFB1 genes are higher in previously established dormant cells (D2OR murine breast cancer cells [44] compared to the proliferative cells (D2A1 cells) in  both 2D and 3D cultures (Figure 1A, all p < 0.02).\u201d This is not true for NR2F1 in 2D. Please correct.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "All my concerns have been satisfactorily addressed"
    },
    "Reviewer_2": {
      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "The authors present interesting findings that a tumor dormancy marker, NR2F1, is \npredominantly expressed in the inflammatory CAFs, and high expression of NR2F1 is \nassociated with suppressed immune response and increased density of stromal cells. \nHowever, this reviewer has a few concerns that need to be addressed before accepting this \narticle for publication.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "This reviewer noticed that all the analysis was performed on the public data sets of bulk RNA-seq or single cell sequencing of primary breast tumors. Can the authors do some analyses using data generated from both primary and metastatic tumors to check if there is any difference of NR2F1 expression, and how NR2F1 expression is correlated with metastasis?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "As mentioned by the authors in Figure 3, there is no correlation between NR2F1 expression in the primary breast tumor and late recurrence. The authors need to analyze the single cell sequencing data and show whether the late recurrence in other organs, such as lung, bone, and brain, other than lymph node, is correlated with NR2F1 expression in the CAFs. Otherwise, the authors cannot make a conclusion that CAF-expressed NR2F1 regulates breast tumor dormancy.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "Moreover, the authors need to provide some, at least minimum, evidence or clues that CAF-expressed NR2F1 is responsible for tumor dormancy regulation.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Line 170, \u201cFigure 1E\u201d should be \u201cFigure 1D\u201d.",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "This reviewer's comments have been addressed."

    "Author": {
      "Author.2.1": "We are grateful to the reviewer for her/his time and effort in reviewing our paper, as well \nas for pointing out issues to improve the paper.",
      "Author.2.2": "We completely agree with the reviewer that it will be informative to demonstrate the \nNR2F1 expression in both primary and metastatic breast cancer and the possible correlation \nof NR2F1 expression with metastasis. In Figure 3C, we present NR2F1 expression in \nprimary breast cancer with and without distant metastases. NR2F1 expression was not \nincreased in the group with later recurrence in four cohorts in this analysis. We also present\nNR2F1 expression between primary and metastatic breast cancer in Figure 3E with no \nsignificant difference. We did not find a clear association of NR2F1 with distant metastasis \nin this study. On the other hand, NR2F1 expression was higher in primary breast tumors\nwith lymph node metastasis in all four cohorts, as shown in Figure 3B, suggesting an \nassociation between NR2F1 and lymph node metastasis. Given these results, we revised \nthe results section as follows.",
      "Author.2.3": "We completely agree with the reviewer that NR2F1 expression in cancer cells and CAFs \nshould be investigated not only in primary but also in metastatic breast cancer using single\u0002cell sequence in order to prove that NR2F1 expression in CAFs affects late recurrence. The \nmain finding of this study is that NR2F1 is predominantly expressed in CAFs rather than \nin all other cell types in the TME, and we do not intend to claim that CAF-expressed NR2F1 \nregulates dormancy. Further, we do not have access to single-cell sequence cohorts of \nmetastatic breast cancer tumors, but it is of our interest, and this will be our future direction.\nIn response to the reviewer, we added the following sentences in the discussion section.",
      "Author.2.4": "We thank the reviewer for closely reading our manuscript and pointing out our oversight. \nWe have corrected the results section as answered in Responce1.",
      "Author.2.5": "We thank the reviewer for reading our manuscript closely and pointing out our oversight. \nAs you indicated, we did not find any significance difference in 2D in Figure 1A and have \ncorrected the results section as follows.",
