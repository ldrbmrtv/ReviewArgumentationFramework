Reviewer 1;Author;1;1;0;the authors did not show further supports to their calculations, namely, by comparing the present calculations with experiments or other theoretical method (from other groups)
Reviewer 1;Author;1;2;0;In earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], a fully relativistic distorted-wave Born approximation (rDWBA) has been developed to describe the relativistic ionization processes. The authors did not mention this method for discussions in the manuscript. The RPWBA method in the manuscript should be compared with the previous rDWBA theory. At least the authors should mention the differences of the two methods and how far the RPWBA can be compared to rDWBA?
Reviewer 1;Author;1;3;0;Again in earlier publications [Physics Reports 315 (1999) 409 and related references], there are existing experiments of triple differential cross sections for relativistic K-shell ionization of Ag, Au, and so on. The authors did not mention these experimental works in the manuscript. It would be nice if the RPWBA method in the manuscript can be compared with the experiments.
Reviewer 1;Author;1;4;0;The authors have not carefully proofread this manuscript. Evidences of this includes (i) some errors in English typing, e.g. line 27 and line 119: it should be ‘plane wave …’ instead of ‘plan wave …’. Line between 33 and 34: it should be ‘The scattered positron and ejected electron …’ instead of ‘The scattered electron and ejected positron …’. (ii) There are repeated Bibliography like ref. 11 and ref. 31.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;1;0;As for minor problems, there are numerous English grammatical errors which I have attempted to list in order to facilitate publication.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;2;0;In addition, I do believe that several figures could be combined in order to minimize journal space.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;1;0;"Page 1:* Line 7: it is referenced to the recent theories given in [2] and [3] which are from years 1994 and 2002 respectively. Maybe the word ""recent"" is not adequate here.* Line 19: ""Coulomb system"" -> ""Coulomb systems"""
Reviewer 3;Author;1;2;0;"Page 2:* Line 36: ""describes the probability"": actually it is the flux ratio, and it could be divergent in some cases. I think one should be careful. Maybe the authors could use ""is related to the probability"" or something like that.* Line 40: ""positrons"" -> ""positron""* Line 43: ""positrons"" -> ""positron"" and ""ground state"" -> ""the ground state""."
Reviewer 3;Author;1;3;0;"Page 3:* unnumbered equation between eqs. (1) and (2) for Vd: in the second term of the right hand side (rhs) the quantities between the vertical bars are vectors and the notation should be different from that of the first term of the rhs, which represent a modulus.* unnumbered equations between eqs. (6) and (7): there should be a connector between the two equations such as a comma or ""and"", the same for eqs. (7) to (8) and (9) to (11)."
Reviewer 3;Author;1;4;0;"Page 4:* Line 80: ""of model"" -> ""of the model""* Line 81: ""in first"" -> ""in the first""* line 86: the gamma letter (the Lorentz factor) must be defined in the text."
Reviewer 3;Author;1;5;0;Page 5:* Lines 103 and 104: Maybe the identification of the used approximation for the three TDCS could be as subscript.* The fact that as the incident energy increases, the TDCS decreases and shifts towards smaller ejection angles for positron impact is said twice between lines 108 and 115.
Reviewer 3;Author;1;6;0;"Page 9:* ""experimental one"" -> ""experimental ones"""
Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;2;"The review article by W Nakel and C. T. Whelan you refer to do indeed tackle the relativistic regime but at the expense of a huge amount of numerical work. So, we think that presenting for the first time a work that incorporates fully analytical results and QED formalism is interesting to the scientific community. The work of W Nakel and C. T. Whelan is devoted to study heavy atoms but Our work is aimed to study analytically the hydrogen atom, we believe that such a comparison is impossible. Another difference that makes comparison difficult is that the work of W Nakel and C. T. Whelan uses coplanar asymmetric geometry while in our work we
 use coplanar symmetric geometry."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;2;3;We are fully aware that the mainstream trend is to study heavy atoms. But some fundamental processes have not until now been investigated fully and analytically and it is our very humble belief that such a fundamental work must be presented to the international scientific community. We are not in a position to compare with these works since they are devoted to heavy atoms.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;3;4;Points (i) and (ii) have been corrected and changed following to the referee’s amendments.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1, 2;As you requested, we have made all necessary changes in our manuscript. A major revision of the paper has been carried out to take all the comments, suggestions and english corrections into account. We believe that the paper has been significantly improved.
