Reviewer 1;Author;1;1;0;1) It is not indicated in the introduction whether any alternative to thin films of yttrium iron garnet is currently being considered for use as magneto-optical resonators.
Reviewer 1;Author;1;2;0;2) How will the temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation hysteresis loops of Dy:CeYIG thin films change when moving to another wavelength range? Is there any dependence on the wavelength?
Reviewer 1;Author;1;3;0;3) How can one explain the increase in the value of the Faraday rotation angle in the range of 30-40 degrees for Dy:CeYIG (Fig. 3f), which is absent for Ce:YIG (Fig. 3f)?
Reviewer 2;Author;1;1;0;"1) For several references, the text ""Error! Reference source not found"" appears. Please check with the editor if this can be fixed."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;2;0;2) In equation (2) and the following line, there are inconcistencies in the use of capital letters for the Faraday rotation angles.
Reviewer 2;Author;1;3;0;"3) Line 111. ""X-ray diffraction patterns"", not ""spectra""."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;4;0;4) Figures 2 (c) and (d). While the Faraday rotation angle appears to decrease more or less linearly with temperature in the Ce:YIG film (as far as can be inferred from the non-linear horizontal scale), the decrease is not taking place at the same rate in the Dy:Ce:YIG film. What causes this different behavior?
Reviewer 2;Author;1;5;0;5) Figures 3 (a) and (b): It could be good to use the same horizontal scale for a clearer comparison.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;"Thanks for the commerts. To the best of our knowledge, rare earth doped yttrium iron garnet is still the main material used for magneto-optical devices. They include bismuth doped YIG, bismuth, terbium doped YIG and cerium doped YIG. Other materials such as Wely semimatels are still under theoretical study[1]. We have added comments to these materials in the manuscript.
 Revisions: Page 1, line 21, added “At present, rare earth doped yttrium iron garnet (RIG) is the most widely used magneto-optical material in integrated MO devices.”"
Author;Reviewer 1;2;2;2;Thanks for the commerts. Absoultly there is also temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation when shift to other wavelengths. However, the transparency window of this material is in the 1550 nm wavelength range. When moving to shorter wavelengths, the absorption of this material increases sharply, making them less practical for photonic device applications.
Author;Reviewer 1;2;3;3;"Thanks for the commerts. The saturation magnetization of rare-earth doped YIG affects the Faraday rotation angle. Sayetat et al. and Ostorero et al. previously reported that the compensation temperature of DyIG is Tcomp = 225 K [2,3], which could decrease the Faraday rotation angle of Dy:CeIG in this work at the temperature below 300 K. Therefore, a higher Faraday rotation may be related to the increase of the saturation magnetization of this material in this temperature range.
 Revisions:Page 5, line 170-173, added “The increase of the Faraday rotation below 40 ℃ is possibly due to the increase of the magnetization of this material at this temperature range, considering a compensation temperature of 225 K in Dy3Fe5O12 [19,20].”.
