      "Reviewer_1.1.1": "It would be better to have a short but clear description about what \"bending elasticity modulus\" is and\n its relevance to biological functions",
      "Reviewer_1.1.2": "The theory section could be in the Method section with both principle and procedures to get kc values",
      "Reviewer_1.1.3": "However, not all results seem to be presented. For example, it is not clear what kind of images were\n recorded, which were used to calculate the kc values, what the sizes/shapes of the fluctuating vesicles\n looked like. How these observations would be different or similar to other types of vesicles.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.4": "It is also not clear about the \u201cthermally induced shape fluctuations\u201d, such as the temperatures and\n incubation length and etc., especially this is a hyperthermophilic archaeal membrane vesicle, which\n would be expected to be more thermostable than those eukaryotic ones.",
      "Reviewer_1.1.5": "We have rewritten the introductory paragraph (Lines 46\u201360).",
      "Reviewer_1.1.6": "There are two reference lists, one for 1\u201331 and another from 1\u201334. There are repeated ones. It\u2019s not\n clear why the case was.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.1": "It is also not clear about the \u201cthermally induced shape fluctuations\u201d, such as the temperatures and\n incubation length and etc., especially this is a hyperthermophilic archaeal membrane vesicle, which\n would be expected to be more thermostable than those eukaryotic ones.\n The observed fluctuations of the membrane do not destabilize it. However, the comment of the\n reviewer is notable and we state in the conclusion of the manuscript (Lines 229\u2013232) that at room\n temperature the thermophilicity is not necessarily related to the bending elasticity.",
      "Reviewer_1.3.2": "If only measured at one temperature, how would it be possible to draw a conclusion with \u201cthermally\n induced shape fluctuations\u201d?",
      "Reviewer_1.3.3": "Is it possible to do the measurement at elevated temperatures",
      "Reviewer_1.3.4": "Would kc be temperature dependent? If yes, what would be the valid range",
      "Reviewer_1.3.5": "The photo added merely shows the shape, but is it possible to show a few time related changes of the\n shape at different temperatures",
      "Reviewer_1.3.6": "The numbering from Lines 306\u2013307 may not be correct as there are two 2.2"

      "Reviewer_2.1.1": "This manuscript described the measurement of bending elasticity of giant vesicles (GVs) prepared by\n archaea-derived lipids. Stroboscopic illumination measurements of GVs and theoretical models about\n shape fluctuation of GVs revealed that the archaeal lipid-based GVs showed the almost same value of\n bending elasticity modulus with synthetic lipid-based GVs. According to the authors, this is the first\n report for the measurement of bending elasticity modulus for archaeal lipid-based GVs. The\n measurement itself is novel, but same methods and theories have been reported in the authors\u2019 previous\n papers. In addition, the number of tables and figures are too low for article. If could, the author should\n add other experimental data.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.2": "I also have questions and comments for acceptance. The list of comments is as follows.\n In Page 1, Lines 27\u201328, the author described \u201cthe experimental set-up was improved \u2026\u201d. However,\n the authors have already reported the measurements of bending elasticity using stroboscopic\n illumination in author\u2019s previous papers (such as Genova et al., J. Optoelectro. Adv. Mat., 2005).\n Describe how the experimental set-up was improved in this paper more precisely.",
      "Reviewer_2.1.3": "As a comparison of archaeal lipids, SOPC was used in this study. SOPC contains an unsaturated bond\n in its alkyl chains and its transition temperature seems to be quite low compared with archaeal lipids.\n What is the reason why the authors selected the SOPC for the representative of eukaryotic lipids?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.4": "In page 4, between line 108 and 109, this equation should be numbered as (6).",
      "Reviewer_2.1.5": "Describe the temperature condition for measurement of fluctuation of GVs. Are there any effects of\n temperature on the fluctuation of GVs?",
      "Reviewer_2.1.6": "In this paper, bending elasticity modulus was measured in pure water. Are there any effects of ionic\n strength or composition of solution on the fluctuation of GVs?",
      "Reviewer_2.3.1": "The manuscript was thoroughly revised according to reviewer\u2019s suggestions and comments. Now this\n revised manuscript can be acceptable for publication"
    },
    "Author": {
      "Author.2.1": "As the referee suggested, we have added data for the bending elasticity modulus of another\n lipid type\u2014POPC lipid membrane. Also, we have added a new figure (Figure 3).",
      "Author.2.2": "A number of improvements of the experimental procedure for the thermally induced shape\n fluctuation method were used in this study: the stroboscopic illumination was improved on several steps\n to achieve a better experimental conditions; a thermostatic stage was used to set and control a constant\n temperature, the analysing procedure was improved by adding strict objective criteria for qualification\n of the vesicle as a whole as well as for acceptance or rejection of a given contour of the sequence of\n recorded images and the white noise contribution to the amplitudes of thermal shape fluctuations was\n R3\n evaluated and taken into account. We have given short description of the improvements made and for\n each of them cited the corresponding articles for detailed explanation. (Lines 181\u2013184; 187\u2013193).",
      "Author.2.3": "SOPC was chosen as both lipid types have transition temperature far below the temperature\n at experiments. In the revised version, we measured the bending modulus for another lipid type (POPC),\n measured and analysed by the same method for the same experimental conditions",
      "Author.2.4": "We have corrected the wrong number",
      "Author.2.5": "The aim of the present study was to obtain the bending elasticity modulus of the archaeal\n membrane at fixed temperature (27 degrees C) far above the phase transition temperature. We have not\n measured the temperature dependence of the bending constant",
      "Author.2.6": "In this work we present the bending elasticity modulus of archaeal lipid membrane in pure\n water environment. We added the details concerning the water purification (Lines 173\u2013175).\n In other works the influence of different admixtures in the aqueous solution around the membrane was\n studied and the values depending on the type and the concentration of it for given lipid were reported.\n As the referee suggested we added such information with the corresponding references in the\n introduction section (Lines 57\u201360).",
      "Author.4.1": "As I understand the referee had no further comments",
      "Author.4.2": "In principal in order to obtain elastic constants you need to apply force and measure the\n deformation that this force causes. If we want to obtain the bending elasticity of lipid vesicle we need a\n force with a very small power. In the case of thermally induced shape fluctuations as a force we use the\n Brownian (thermal) motion of water molecules, bombarding the membrane. This force is stochastic (we\n do not know its instant value), but the mean value of it is proportional to the temperature. As a result of\n this stochastic bombardment the lipid vesicle deforms (changes its shape or fluctuates). We acquire a\n big amount of pictures of fluctuating vesicle in order to get the mean value of the deformation that our\n force causes. To extract mean we need to have stationary conditions over the time, so the mean is taken,\n that is why it is really important to have constant temperature throughout the experiment.",
      "Author.4.3": "Using our experimental system we can measure bending elasticity also at higher\n temperatures (up to approximately 40 degrees C).",
      "Author.4.4": "The bending elasticity modulus depends on the temperature below and near the phase\n transition temperature, but far above the phase transition temperature (this is the case in our experiment)\n the bending elasticity modulus is practically constant. See: Temperature and Chain Length Effects on\n Bending Elasticity of Phosphatidylcholine Bilayers. Fernandez-Puente, I. Bivas, M. D. Mitov and P.\n Meleard, Europhys. Lett., 28, 181 (1994). We have added this text to the Discussion (Lines 234\u2013237)\n and also added the reference to the reference list (ref. [35]).",
      "Author.4.5": "It is not a problem for us to make pictures of a fluctuating vesicle at different temperatures,\n but these photos would not be related to the manuscript",
      "Author.4.6": "We thank the referee for pointing to negligent mistakes in numbering. We have corrected\n wrong numbering of subsections",
