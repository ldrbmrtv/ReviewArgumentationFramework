Reviewer 1;Author;1;1;0;"It would be better to have a short but clear description about what ""bending elasticity modulus"" is and
 its relevance to biological functions"
Reviewer 1;Author;1;2;0;The theory section could be in the Method section with both principle and procedures to get kc values
Reviewer 1;Author;1;3;0;"However, not all results seem to be presented. For example, it is not clear what kind of images were
 recorded, which were used to calculate the kc values, what the sizes/shapes of the fluctuating vesicles
 looked like. How these observations would be different or similar to other types of vesicles."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;4;0;"It is also not clear about the “thermally induced shape fluctuations”, such as the temperatures and
 incubation length and etc., especially this is a hyperthermophilic archaeal membrane vesicle, which
 would be expected to be more thermostable than those eukaryotic ones."
Reviewer 1;Author;1;5;0;We have rewritten the introductory paragraph (Lines 46–60).
Reviewer 1;Author;1;6;0;"There are two reference lists, one for 1–31 and another from 1–34. There are repeated ones. It’s not
 clear why the case was."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;1;0;"This manuscript described the measurement of bending elasticity of giant vesicles (GVs) prepared by
 archaea-derived lipids. Stroboscopic illumination measurements of GVs and theoretical models about
 shape fluctuation of GVs revealed that the archaeal lipid-based GVs showed the almost same value of
 bending elasticity modulus with synthetic lipid-based GVs. According to the authors, this is the first
 report for the measurement of bending elasticity modulus for archaeal lipid-based GVs. The
 measurement itself is novel, but same methods and theories have been reported in the authors’ previous
 papers. In addition, the number of tables and figures are too low for article. If could, the author should
 add other experimental data."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;2;0;"I also have questions and comments for acceptance. The list of comments is as follows.
 In Page 1, Lines 27–28, the author described “the experimental set-up was improved …”. However,
 the authors have already reported the measurements of bending elasticity using stroboscopic
 illumination in author’s previous papers (such as Genova et al., J. Optoelectro. Adv. Mat., 2005).
 Describe how the experimental set-up was improved in this paper more precisely."
Reviewer 2;Author;1;3;0;"As a comparison of archaeal lipids, SOPC was used in this study. SOPC contains an unsaturated bond
 in its alkyl chains and its transition temperature seems to be quite low compared with archaeal lipids.
 What is the reason why the authors selected the SOPC for the representative of eukaryotic lipids?"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;4;0;In page 4, between line 108 and 109, this equation should be numbered as (6).
Reviewer 2;Author;1;5;0;"Describe the temperature condition for measurement of fluctuation of GVs. Are there any effects of
 temperature on the fluctuation of GVs?"
Reviewer 2;Author;1;6;0;"In this paper, bending elasticity modulus was measured in pure water. Are there any effects of ionic
 strength or composition of solution on the fluctuation of GVs?"
Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;"Bending modulus is a material constant which does not depend on the size and shape of the
 object, but on the composition of the vesicle membrane and aqueous solution used (Lines 121–123 in the
 new version). We have inserted a definition of the membrane bending modulus (Lines 115–116) while
 the text regarding this issue extends between Lines 112–128."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;2;2;"As the referee suggested The Theory and Experimental section were organized into the
 Section “Materials and Methods”. Other sections were renumbered accordingly."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;3;3;"As it was explained in the text our experimental method is developed for application to almost
 spherical vesicles. Vesicles with diameters between 20 and 40 micrometers were considered, whose
 deviations from spherical shape (fluctuation of the radius) were small in comparison with the mean
 sphere radius. We added the information concerning the shape and the size of the studied objects and
 added pictures of the equatorial cross section of a fluctuating vesicle (new Figure 3), as seen under the
 phase contrast microscope."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;4;4;"The observed fluctuations of the membrane do not destabilize it. However, the comment of the
 reviewer is notable and we state in the conclusion of the manuscript (Lines 229–232) that at room
 temperature the thermophilicity is not necessarily related to the bending elasticity."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;5;5;"It would also be helpful to clarify/expand the description about the drug delivery system using the
 archaeal vesicle.
 The first sentence in the introduction section should be corrected as cell should not be considered to
 be “the building block of life”. It’s better to re-write the “basic motivation” for the study."
Author;Reviewer 1;2;6;6;Thank you for the comment, there was a mistake. We have tidied and updated the references
Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1;"As the referee suggested, we have added data for the bending elasticity modulus of another
 lipid type—POPC lipid membrane. Also, we have added a new figure (Figure 3)."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;2;2;"A number of improvements of the experimental procedure for the thermally induced shape
 fluctuation method were used in this study: the stroboscopic illumination was improved on several steps
 to achieve a better experimental conditions; a thermostatic stage was used to set and control a constant
 temperature, the analysing procedure was improved by adding strict objective criteria for qualification
 of the vesicle as a whole as well as for acceptance or rejection of a given contour of the sequence of
 recorded images and the white noise contribution to the amplitudes of thermal shape fluctuations was
 R3
 evaluated and taken into account. We have given short description of the improvements made and for
 each of them cited the corresponding articles for detailed explanation. (Lines 181–184; 187–193)."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;3;3;"SOPC was chosen as both lipid types have transition temperature far below the temperature
 at experiments. In the revised version, we measured the bending modulus for another lipid type (POPC),
 measured and analysed by the same method for the same experimental conditions"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;4;4;We have corrected the wrong number
Author;Reviewer 2;2;5;5;"The aim of the present study was to obtain the bending elasticity modulus of the archaeal
 membrane at fixed temperature (27 degrees C) far above the phase transition temperature. We have not
 measured the temperature dependence of the bending constant"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;6;6;"In this work we present the bending elasticity modulus of archaeal lipid membrane in pure
 water environment. We added the details concerning the water purification (Lines 173–175).
 In other works the influence of different admixtures in the aqueous solution around the membrane was
 studied and the values depending on the type and the concentration of it for given lipid were reported.
 As the referee suggested we added such information with the corresponding references in the
 introduction section (Lines 57–60)."
Reviewer 1;Author;3;1;0;"It is also not clear about the “thermally induced shape fluctuations”, such as the temperatures and
 incubation length and etc., especially this is a hyperthermophilic archaeal membrane vesicle, which
 would be expected to be more thermostable than those eukaryotic ones.
 The observed fluctuations of the membrane do not destabilize it. However, the comment of the
 reviewer is notable and we state in the conclusion of the manuscript (Lines 229–232) that at room
 temperature the thermophilicity is not necessarily related to the bending elasticity."
Reviewer 1;Author;3;2;0;"If only measured at one temperature, how would it be possible to draw a conclusion with “thermally
 induced shape fluctuations”?"
Reviewer 1;Author;3;3;0;Is it possible to do the measurement at elevated temperatures
Reviewer 1;Author;3;4;0;Would kc be temperature dependent? If yes, what would be the valid range
Reviewer 1;Author;3;5;0;"The photo added merely shows the shape, but is it possible to show a few time related changes of the
 shape at different temperatures"
Reviewer 1;Author;3;6;0;The numbering from Lines 306–307 may not be correct as there are two 2.2
Reviewer 2;Author;3;1;0;"The manuscript was thoroughly revised according to reviewer’s suggestions and comments. Now this
 revised manuscript can be acceptable for publication"
Author;Reviewer 1;4;1;1;"We thank the reviewer for further comments and hope that we can clarify the issues as given
 below. We have made changes in the manuscript (marked red) and added one new reference (ref. [35])."
Author;Reviewer 1;4;2;2;"In principal in order to obtain elastic constants you need to apply force and measure the
 deformation that this force causes. If we want to obtain the bending elasticity of lipid vesicle we need a
 force with a very small power. In the case of thermally induced shape fluctuations as a force we use the
 Brownian (thermal) motion of water molecules, bombarding the membrane. This force is stochastic (we
 do not know its instant value), but the mean value of it is proportional to the temperature. As a result of
 this stochastic bombardment the lipid vesicle deforms (changes its shape or fluctuates). We acquire a
 big amount of pictures of fluctuating vesicle in order to get the mean value of the deformation that our
 force causes. To extract mean we need to have stationary conditions over the time, so the mean is taken,
 that is why it is really important to have constant temperature throughout the experiment."
Author;Reviewer 1;4;3;3;"Using our experimental system we can measure bending elasticity also at higher
 temperatures (up to approximately 40 degrees C)."
Author;Reviewer 1;4;4;4;"The bending elasticity modulus depends on the temperature below and near the phase
 transition temperature, but far above the phase transition temperature (this is the case in our experiment)
 the bending elasticity modulus is practically constant. See: Temperature and Chain Length Effects on
 Bending Elasticity of Phosphatidylcholine Bilayers. Fernandez-Puente, I. Bivas, M. D. Mitov and P.
 Meleard, Europhys. Lett., 28, 181 (1994). We have added this text to the Discussion (Lines 234–237)
 and also added the reference to the reference list (ref. [35])."
Author;Reviewer 1;4;5;5;"It is not a problem for us to make pictures of a fluctuating vesicle at different temperatures,
 but these photos would not be related to the manuscript"
Author;Reviewer 1;4;6;6;"We thank the referee for pointing to negligent mistakes in numbering. We have corrected
 wrong numbering of subsections"
Author;Reviewer 2;4;1;1;As I understand the referee had no further comments
