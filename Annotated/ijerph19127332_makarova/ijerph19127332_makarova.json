Besides, our study focuses on estimating the children\u2019s SIRs of from e\u2012waste disassembly areas by collecting and analyzing selected tracer elements in matched samples of their consumed food, feces, and urine, as well as soil samples from their play areas. We have examined the tracer elements in the food. And when we calculated the SIR, we also used the parameter \u201cCfood\u201d (equation 1) to analyze the food intake.\nIn addition, children\u2019s feces and urine belong to biological samples, which is sufficient to calculate the SIR. Application of more biotic samples that you suggested is useful for our study, however, it is hard to get other samples from children, such as blood and tissue.\nAt last, we also added the heavy metals information in resident or park green areas: \u201cIn resident and park green areas, the highest concentration of heavy metals is Zn and the lowest is Cd. The concentrations of heavy metals in park green areas were slightly higher than that in residential area, which may attribute to the difference of soil environmental quality management and control policy between these areas. Integrated data from the resident and park green areas, the median concentrations (mg/kg) of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were 48.8, 63.9, 128, 413, 6.30, 0.513, and 115, respectively.\u201d",
