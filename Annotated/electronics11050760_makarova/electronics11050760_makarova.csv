Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;1;According to reviewer’s comment, we added Equation (14), and Tables 3 and 4 on the number of additions for the VVC inverse transforms. 
Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1;"According to the reviewer’s comment, we modified and added some keywords as follows:
We replaced “Keywords: VVC; HEVC; video coding; transform; computational complexity”
With “Keywords: VVC (Versatile Video Coding), HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding, Linear 
Inverse Transform, computational complexity, DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), Discrete 
Sine Transform (DST), BD-rate”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;2;2;"According to the reviewer's comments, we updated the last paragraph of Section 1 as follows:
We replaced “Section 2 presents a proposed inverse transform using linearity to reduce the computational complexity.” With
“In Section 2.1, we introduce the transforms used in VVC. And we propose a fast inverse transform using linearity to reduce the computational complexity in Section 2.2.”"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;3;3;"According to the reviewer’s comment, we divided Section 2 as follows:
2. VVC Transforms and Proposed Method
2.1. Introduction to DCT-II, DST-VII, and DCT-VIII 
2.2. Propose Fast Inverse Transform Using Linearity "
Author;Reviewer 2;2;4;4,5;"According to the reviewer’s comment, we included the following sentence in the end of 3. Experimental Results section on page 11:
~~ “Fast encoding methods only in the encoder side were proposed to reduce the encoding 
complexity of VVC but all the fast encoding methods increased the BD-rates [29][30][31] in 
terms of the bit-rate reduction so that the proposed inverse transform using linearity in the 
decoder side differs from those approaches in that it keeps the BD-rate in VVC while reducing 
the decoding complexity. If the proposed inverse transform is applied to the VVC standard, 
the inverse transform of the VVC standard should be changed to include the proposed method. 
Therefore, the proposed method can be considered in the next-generation video coding 
standards because it reduces the decoding complexity while the BD-rate is maintained.” ~~ 
And three new references [29],[30], and [31] in Reference section were included."
Author;Reviewer 2;2;5;6;"According to the reviewer’s comment, we added the future directions in the conclusion section as follows:
“The proposed method can be considered in the next-generation video coding standards 
because it reduces the decoding complexity while the BD-rate is maintained.”
"
Author;Reviewer 2;2;6;7;"Only Table 6 was shown before it was used. So, we removed the word Table 6 in the following sentence:
~~. “Table 3 lists the percentages of horizontal and vertical transforms in VTM-8.2 for all test 
sequences in Table 6 which are to be explained in Section 3—at each Quantization …” ~~~"

“In this paper, we analyze the number of multiplications of the existing fast transform methods in the VVC standard, and we propose a new fast inverse transform using the number

Author;Reviewer 2;4;2;2;"According to reviewer’s comment, we added Discussion Section.
4. Discussion
The previously proposed fast methods were mainly addressed to reduce complexity
in the video encoder with the BD-rate loss. In [29], a fast intra mode decision algorithm was proposed and the result showed the encoding time savings of 51%~53% with BD-rate loss of
0.93%~1.08%. A low-complexity CTU (Coding Tree Unit) partition structure decision and fast
intra mode decision were proposed in [30] and showed the average encoding time saving of
63% with the BD-rate loss of 1.93%. The fast encoders for video coding reduce only the encoder
complexity but the BD-rates were always increased without decreasing the decoder
complexity. However, the proposed fast inverse transform is different from the fast encoders
in that it reduces the complexity in both the encoder and decoder while maintaining the BD-
rate of the VVC standard. In the RA configuration, the proposed method reduces the average
encoding and decoding times by approximately (4, 10) %, respectively, while maintaining
average BD-rates.
If the proposed inverse transform using the number of non-zero coefficients is applied to the
VVC standard, the inverse transform of the VVC standard should be changed to include the
proposed method. This fact can be demerit. However, the proposed method can be considered
in the next-generation video coding standards because it achieves decoding run-time saving,
while maintaining average BD-rate. In addition to that, the proposed method is more effective
in high QP value than in low QP value, because the higher the QP value is, the fewer no-zero
coefficients there are."
