Author;Reviewer 1;2;1;3;Thank for your kindly suggestion. We feel sorry for the unclear statement. We have modified this part in revised manuscript (Line 233-236). This sentence has been changed to “A suspension of A. rhizogenes strain GV3101 containing the pORER4-OfSPL11-GFP recombinant plasmid was aspirated using a 1 mL range syringe (needle not included), and the suspension was gently injected into the abaxial surface of four-week-old tobacco leaves avoiding the leaf veins.”
Author;Reviewer 1;2;2;4;Special thanks to you for your good suggestion. We have revised the manuscript according to your comments (Line 274-277). This sentence has been changed to “A. tumefaciens suspensions containing the fusion vector OfSPL11pro: LUC was transiently transformed into O. fragrans callus using vacuum infiltration, and then the O. fragrans callus were cultured in a symbiotic medium containing 0 mM and 200 mM NaCl.”
Author;Reviewer 1;2;3;5;Thank you for your comment. We have modified this part in revised manuscript (Line 326-328). This sentence has been changed to “To better understand why OfSPL11 transgenic lines exhibit enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, we analyzed the expression of known abiotic stress response genes in 3-week-old wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis.”
Author;Reviewer 1;2;4;6;We feel sorry for the unclear statement. In a previous study (Ding, 2021), the LlWRKY39 promoter was fused to a pGreenII-0800-LUC vector using a recombinant ligase (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The constructed vector and an empty vector (control) were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pSoup), which was used to transform N. benthamiana leaves. The LUC signal increased profoundly after subjection to HS (37℃), although under normal conditions (room temperature), the LUC signal was very low, which implied that HS activated the promoter activity of LlWRKY39. In this study, the experimental operations, reagents and plant materials were were the same as the previous study, except for the different treatment conditions. Therefore, we suggest that salt stress can induce the activity of the OfSPL11 promoter.

Author;Reviewer 2;2;1;1;Thank you for your comment. We feel sorry for the unclear statement. In our study, we used the amino acid sequence of OfSPL11 to compute the protein model. Secondary structure predictions were conducted on the PRABI (http://www.prabi.fr/spip.php?page=sommaire) protein structure prediction server. The ExPASy (http://web.expasy.org) was used to analyze the molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point, and other physiochemical properties of the translated protein. Similar methods of operation and efforts can be found in other articles (Islam, 2021). Once again,we sincerely thank you for the recommended method, which we will use in future studies.
Author;Reviewer 2;2;2;2;"Thank you for your comment. We tested the amplification efficiency before using housekeeping genes. Referring to the previous study of Arabidopsis housekeeping genes (Dheda, 2004; Czechowski, 2005; Hou, 2018), we selected Atactin1 (F: AGGCACCTCTTAACCCTAAAGC, R: GGACAACGGAATCTCTCAGC), Atactin2 (F: TTGTGCTGGATTCTGGTGATGG, R: CCGCTCTCTGCTGTTGTGGTG) and Atactin8 (F: GAATTACCCGACGGACA, R: ACGGTCTGCAATACCT) were tested for efficiency, and we found that the best result was Atactin2. The best housekeeping gene for O. fragrans is OfACT, which has been reported in a previous study (Zhang, 2015)."
